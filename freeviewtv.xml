      <director>Pitt won an Emmy as part of the producing team of the HBO tv movie The Normal Heart.      Michael Peña     Shia LaBeouf (Actor)     Born:  June 11</director>
      <director>1986 in Los Angeles</director>
      <director>California</director>
      <director>United States    Trivia:  Shia LaBeouf decided</director>
      <director>during his preteen years</director>
      <director>to launch himself as an actor</director>
      <director>and stories abound concerning how far he carried his own drive to establish himself. According to People Weekly magazine</director>
      <director>LaBeouf auditioned for Even Stevens (2000)</director>
      <director>the Disney Channel series that delivered him into the spotlight</director>
      <director>and subsequently told each of the youngsters who were waiting to audition that he had the part -- thus eliminating the competition. Such determination</director>
      <director>coupled with raw ability and charisma</director>
      <director>doubtless helped propel LaBeouf straight to the head of Hollywood's young stars.Born on June 11</director>
      <director>1986</director>
      <director>in Los Angeles</director>
      <director>LaBeouf grew up in the neighborhood of Echo Park</director>
      <director>and was raised in a decidedly colorful family of mixed ethnicity. His Cajun father</director>
      <director>Jeffrey LaBeouf</director>
      <director>was a Vietnam vet who held a series of odd jobs as a circus clown</director>
      <director>a sno-cone salesman</director>
      <director>and a stand-up comic. Shia's Jewish mother</director>
      <director>Shayna</director>
      <director>worked as a clothier and jewelry craftswoman. Upset about his mother's financial struggles after his parents split</director>
      <director>Shia observed another boy of about the same age (a cast member of Dr. Quinn</director>
      <director>Medicine Woman) whose financial returns from Quinn gave him a posh lifestyle. LaBeouf suddenly understood the financial benefits of before-the-camera work</director>
      <director>and -- though he had no formal dramatic training -- foresaw himself breaking into acting via comedy. He used a phone book to find an agent</director>
      <director>then honed a stand-up comedy act over the course of two years</director>
      <director>that found him (at age 12) delivering "blue" routines to adult audiences at a Pasadena comedy club</director>
      <director>The Ice House. By his own admission</director>
      <director>LaBeouf was booted out of every school he attended (for his notoriously profane mouth and for other reasons)</director>
      <director>but he more than compensated for this with his professional drive. By 2000</director>
      <director>he auditioned for the Even Stevens series on Disney</director>
      <director>and landed the part.That sitcom concerned the relationship between Louis Stevens (LaBeouf)</director>
      <director>a silly and goofy teen</director>
      <director>and his older sister</director>
      <director>Ren (Christy Carlson Romano). The program quickly found an audience on Disney and lasted for several seasons; its popularity spawned a small-screen feature</director>
      <director>The Even Stevens Movie</director>
      <director>in 2003. The time span of 2002 to 2003 was a busy one for LaBeouf -- arguably his breakthrough period. In addition to The Even Stevens Movie</director>
      <director>the actor signed on to participate in season two of the controversial Project Greenlight</director>
      <director>the Damon and Affleck-created national contest for aspiring indie filmmakers</director>
      <director>with its attached HBO reality series of the same name. Thus</director>
      <director>at-home viewers had the opportunity to watch LaBeouf</director>
      <director>Elden Hensen</director>
      <director>Kathleen Quinlan</director>
      <director>Amy Smart</director>
      <director>and other actors endure the tumultuous production of Efram Potelle and Kyle Rankin's quirky comedy drama The Battle of Shaker Heights</director>
      <director>months prior to that film's release. When the finished film debuted in August of 2003</director>
      <director>it did so to generally terrible reviews</director>
      <director>but a number of journalists (Roger Ebert among them) singled out LaBeouf's lead performance as something special amid a decidedly flawed film.That same year</director>
      <director>LaBeouf starred in the Andrew Davis-directed Disney fantasy Holes</director>
      <director>as a youngster sent to an oddball Texas detention center and forced to dig a series of 5-foot-deep pits in the desert sun for mysterious reasons; it scored with the public and press and became one of the sleeper hits of 2003. And indeed</director>
      <director>its success doubtless spurred LaBeouf on to even greater heights</director>
      <director>his dramatic ability honed even more sharply by his interaction with co-star Jon Voight (Coming Home)</director>
      <director>whom LaBeouf would later list as a key professional influence. In late 2004</director>
      <director>LaBeouf signed on for the lead in another Disney film</director>
      <director>The Greatest Game Ever Played (2005) -- a biopic of golfer Francis Ouimet directed by Bill Paxton; the film itself divided critics rather sharply but provided an outstanding showcase for LaBeouf's talents. The next several years found LaBeouf signing on for several of the most sought-after A-list roles in Hollywood -- from director Francis Lawrence's apocalyptic fantasy Constantine (2005)</director>
      <director>as a demon-slayer fighting alongside Keanu Reeves; to Dito Montiel's A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints</director>
      <director>as a young man struggling to find a different road out of the ghetto than crime and prison. In 2007</director>
      <director>the actor voiced a surfing penguin in the CG-animated comedy Surf's Up</director>
      <director>and geared up for his role as Sam Witwicky in one of the most hotly anticipated releases of the year</director>
      <director>the Michael Bay-directed Transformers -- based on the action figures that were rabidly popular in the mid-'80s. At the same time</director>
      <director>audiences could catch LaBeouf in Salton Sea-director D.J. Caruso's thriller Disturbia -- the tale of a deeply depressed</director>
      <director>homebound teen who teams up with a local girl to prove that their next door neighbor is a much sought-after serial killer.LaBeouf would continue to ride his popularity surge in the realm of latter-day sequels</director>
      <director>playing Harrison Ford's sidekick in 2008's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</director>
      <director>and young financial exec Jake Moore in 2010's Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. Neither film was well received by audiences or critics</director>
      <director>but LaBeouf still had the Transformer's franchise in his pocket</director>
      <director>and he'd continue with it for 2009's Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and 2011's Transformers: Dark of the Moon. In 2012 he tried his hand at a period piece with the bootlegging drama Lawless.      Logan Lerman (Actor)     Born:  January 19</director>
      <director>1992 in Beverly Hills</director>
      <director>United States    Trivia:  In terms of chosen material</director>
      <director>actor Logan Lerman scored points at an early age for tackling some of the most difficult parts imaginable for a preteenager. His first major role was that of Jason</director>
      <director>the put-upon young son of a harried single mother (Drew Barrymore) and a heroin addict (Steve Zahn) in Penny Marshall's coming-of-age period picture Riding in Cars with Boys (2001). Not long after</director>
      <director>Lerman signed to portray the eight-year-old version of the central character in the controversial (and critically reviled) sci-fi melodrama The Butterfly Effect (2004) -- a part that found his character strangled</director>
      <director>beaten</director>
      <director>sexually abused</director>
      <director>and fallen prey to a host of other atrocities. Then</director>
      <director>after these arresting and emotionally challenging debuts</director>
      <director>Lerman dropped down a few notches as far as the intensity of the material he sought out. From 2004-2005</director>
      <director>Lerman co-starred in the short-lived drama series Jack &amp; Bobby</director>
      <director>playing Bobby</director>
      <director>who was destined to one day become President of the United States. He also played an average young boy determined to band together with his buddies and save some rare owls in the family-friendly picture Hoot and portrayed the son of Christian Bale in James Mangold's Western remake 3:10 to Yuma. In the Joel Schumacher thriller The Number 23 (2007)</director>
      <director>Lerman played Robin Sparrow</director>
      <director>the son of a seemingly normal man (Jim Carrey) driven around the bend by a numerical mystery. He went on to appear in Gamer before scoring his most-high profile part taking on the role of Percy Jackson</director>
      <director>the hero of a popular series of fantasy novels</director>
      <director>in Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief. He followed that up by tackling the role of D'Artagnan in the 2011 version of The Three Musketeers before returning to smaller fare in The Perks of Being a Wallflower.</director>

      <director>Shayna</director>
      <director>worked as a clothier and jewelry craftswoman. Upset about his mother's financial struggles after his parents split</director>
      <director>Shia observed another boy of about the same age (a cast member of Dr. Quinn</director>
      <director>Medicine Woman) whose financial returns from Quinn gave him a posh lifestyle. LaBeouf suddenly understood the financial benefits of before-the-camera work</director>
      <director>and -- though he had no formal dramatic training -- foresaw himself breaking into acting via comedy. He used a phone book to find an agent</director>
      <director>then honed a stand-up comedy act over the course of two years</director>
      <director>that found him (at age 12) delivering "blue" routines to adult audiences at a Pasadena comedy club</director>
      <director>The Ice House. By his own admission</director>
      <director>LaBeouf was booted out of every school he attended (for his notoriously profane mouth and for other reasons)</director>
      <director>but he more than compensated for this with his professional drive. By 2000</director>
      <director>he auditioned for the Even Stevens series on Disney</director>
      <director>and landed the part.That sitcom concerned the relationship between Louis Stevens (LaBeouf)</director>
      <director>a silly and goofy teen</director>
      <director>and his older sister</director>
      <director>Ren (Christy Carlson Romano). The program quickly found an audience on Disney and lasted for several seasons; its popularity spawned a small-screen feature</director>
      <director>The Even Stevens Movie</director>
      <director>in 2003. The time span of 2002 to 2003 was a busy one for LaBeouf -- arguably his breakthrough period. In addition to The Even Stevens Movie</director>
      <director>the actor signed on to participate in season two of the controversial Project Greenlight</director>
      <director>the Damon and Affleck-created national contest for aspiring indie filmmakers</director>
      <director>with its attached HBO reality series of the same name. Thus</director>
      <director>at-home viewers had the opportunity to watch LaBeouf</director>
      <director>Elden Hensen</director>
      <director>Kathleen Quinlan</director>
      <director>Amy Smart</director>
      <director>and other actors endure the tumultuous production of Efram Potelle and Kyle Rankin's quirky comedy drama The Battle of Shaker Heights</director>
      <director>months prior to that film's release. When the finished film debuted in August of 2003</director>
      <director>it did so to generally terrible reviews</director>
      <director>but a number of journalists (Roger Ebert among them) singled out LaBeouf's lead performance as something special amid a decidedly flawed film.That same year</director>
      <director>LaBeouf starred in the Andrew Davis-directed Disney fantasy Holes</director>
      <director>as a youngster sent to an oddball Texas detention center and forced to dig a series of 5-foot-deep pits in the desert sun for mysterious reasons; it scored with the public and press and became one of the sleeper hits of 2003. And indeed</director>
      <director>its success doubtless spurred LaBeouf on to even greater heights</director>
      <director>his dramatic ability honed even more sharply by his interaction with co-star Jon Voight (Coming Home)</director>
      <director>whom LaBeouf would later list as a key professional influence. In late 2004</director>
      <director>LaBeouf signed on for the lead in another Disney film</director>
      <director>The Greatest Game Ever Played (2005) -- a biopic of golfer Francis Ouimet directed by Bill Paxton; the film itself divided critics rather sharply but provided an outstanding showcase for LaBeouf's talents. The next several years found LaBeouf signing on for several of the most sought-after A-list roles in Hollywood -- from director Francis Lawrence's apocalyptic fantasy Constantine (2005)</director>
      <director>as a demon-slayer fighting alongside Keanu Reeves; to Dito Montiel's A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints</director>
      <director>as a young man struggling to find a different road out of the ghetto than crime and prison. In 2007</director>
      <director>the actor voiced a surfing penguin in the CG-animated comedy Surf's Up</director>
      <director>and geared up for his role as Sam Witwicky in one of the most hotly anticipated releases of the year</director>
      <director>the Michael Bay-directed Transformers -- based on the action figures that were rabidly popular in the mid-'80s. At the same time</director>
      <director>audiences could catch LaBeouf in Salton Sea-director D.J. Caruso's thriller Disturbia -- the tale of a deeply depressed</director>
      <director>homebound teen who teams up with a local girl to prove that their next door neighbor is a much sought-after serial killer.LaBeouf would continue to ride his popularity surge in the realm of latter-day sequels</director>
      <director>playing Harrison Ford's sidekick in 2008's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</director>
      <director>and young financial exec Jake Moore in 2010's Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. Neither film was well received by audiences or critics</director>
      <director>but LaBeouf still had the Transformer's franchise in his pocket</director>
      <director>and he'd continue with it for 2009's Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and 2011's Transformers: Dark of the Moon. In 2012 he tried his hand at a period piece with the bootlegging drama Lawless.      Logan Lerman (Actor)     Born:  January 19</director>
      <director>1992 in Beverly Hills</director>
      <director>United States    Trivia:  In terms of chosen material</director>
      <director>actor Logan Lerman scored points at an early age for tackling some of the most difficult parts imaginable for a preteenager. His first major role was that of Jason</director>
      <director>the put-upon young son of a harried single mother (Drew Barrymore) and a heroin addict (Steve Zahn) in Penny Marshall's coming-of-age period picture Riding in Cars with Boys (2001). Not long after</director>
      <director>Lerman signed to portray the eight-year-old version of the central character in the controversial (and critically reviled) sci-fi melodrama The Butterfly Effect (2004) -- a part that found his character strangled</director>
      <director>beaten</director>
      <director>sexually abused</director>
      <director>and fallen prey to a host of other atrocities. Then</director>
      <director>after these arresting and emotionally challenging debuts</director>
      <director>Lerman dropped down a few notches as far as the intensity of the material he sought out. From 2004-2005</director>
      <director>Lerman co-starred in the short-lived drama series Jack &amp; Bobby</director>
      <director>playing Bobby</director>
      <director>who was destined to one day become President of the United States. He also played an average young boy determined to band together with his buddies and save some rare owls in the family-friendly picture Hoot and portrayed the son of Christian Bale in James Mangold's Western remake 3:10 to Yuma. In the Joel Schumacher thriller The Number 23 (2007)</director>
      <director>Lerman played Robin Sparrow</director>
      <director>the son of a seemingly normal man (Jim Carrey) driven around the bend by a numerical mystery. He went on to appear in Gamer before scoring his most-high profile part taking on the role of Percy Jackson</director>
      <director>the hero of a popular series of fantasy novels</director>
      <director>in Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief. He followed that up by tackling the role of D'Artagnan in the 2011 version of The Three Musketeers before returning to smaller fare in The Perks of Being a Wallflower.</director>

      <writer>Van Der Beek proceeded to branch out with film and stage work</writer>
      <writer>and in the process managed to be anointed in 1998 as one of People Magazine's "50 Most Beautiful."Born March 8</writer>
      <writer>1977 to a cell phone salesman father and a mother who ran a gymnastics studio</writer>
      <writer>Van Der Beek was raised in his hometown of Cheshire</writer>
      <writer>Connecticut. The oldest of three children</writer>
      <writer>he was an honors student and excelled at football until an injury sidelined his budding career. In its own way the injury proved to be serendipitous</writer>

      <writer>Van Der Beek made his professional debut at the age of 16 in the Off-Broadway production of Finding the Sun</writer>
      <writer>which was written and directed by Edward Albee. More stage work ensued</writer>

      <writer>but it was his starring role in Dawson's Creek</writer>
      <writer>premiering in January of 1998</writer>
      <writer>that gave Van Der Beek his big break. The show's success with critics and audiences alike propelled Van Der Beek and his fellow cast members into the limelight</writer>
      <writer>and soon Van Der Beek secured his first major film roles</writer>
      <writer>first in the little-seen Harvest (1998)</writer>

      <writer>his career had certainly gotten off to a very positive start.Though to this point Van Der Beek's success had been built on the image of the squeaky clean</writer>
      <writer>all-American small town boy</writer>
      <writer>a pair of efforts following the millennial turnover signaled that the actor who had become the very personification of white-bred wholesomeness was determined to create a new</writer>

      <writer>his efforts would be cemented later that same year with the subsequent release of The Rules of Attraction. Directed by Pulp Fiction collaborator Roger Avery (Killing Zoe) and based on a novel by American Psycho author Brett Easton Ellis</writer>

      <writer>Dragonslayer (1981)</writer>
      <writer>MacNicol essayed one of his few leading-man roles as Galen</writer>
      <writer>a hapless assistant sorcerer who makes good. His most celebrated film assignment was as Stingo</writer>
      <writer>the innocent-bystander narrator of Sophie's Choice. Most of the time</writer>
      <writer>MacNicol has been seen in comical</writer>
      <writer>sycophantic roles</writer>
      <writer>such as the easily demonized Janocz in Ghostbusters II (1989) and the unctuous camp counselor in Addams Family Values (1993). On television</writer>
      <writer>Peter MacNicol starred in the brief Norman Lear political lampoon The Powers That Be (1992) and co-starred as Alan Birch on the CBS medical drama Chicago Hope (1994).MacNicol continued to play small but indelible roles in a variety of small but indelible films throughout the mid-'90s.

Despite his respectable feature-film success</writer>
      <writer>however</writer>
      <writer>MacNicol wouldn't get solid mainstream recognition until the 1997 debut of Ally McBeal. The show featured MacNicol as John Cage</writer>
      <writer>an immensely insecure but highly gifted lawyer whose lovable</writer>
      <writer>if over-sensitive</writer>
      <writer>nature tugged at the heartstrings of Ally (Calista Flockhart) and television audiences alike. MacNicol remained a lead character on the show from 1997 to 2002</writer>
      <writer>and was able to participate not just as an actor</writer>
      <writer>but also as a director</writer>
      <writer>screenwriter</writer>

      <writer>Attorney at Law</writer>
      <writer>The Batman</writer>
      <writer>The Spectacular Spider-Man helped MacNicol maintain a high profile in the following years</writer>
      <writer>and in 2012 he could be seen as the Secretary of Defense in the big-budget game board adaptaion Battleship.      Charley Koontz (Actor)     Born:  August 10</writer>

      <writer>United States    Trivia:  Though he has since dropped the age restrictive "Lil'" for the more mature Bow Wow</writer>
      <writer>this rapper-turned-actor stands tall on both stage and screen no matter what moniker he assumes. Born Shad Gregory Moss in Reynoldsburg</writer>
      <writer>OH</writer>
      <writer>Lil' Bow Wow dropped his first rhymes at the tender age of three</writer>
      <writer>and after hooking up with producer Jermaine Dupri</writer>
      <writer>the young rapper released his debut album</writer>
      <writer>Beware of Dog</writer>
      <writer>in 2000. The following year</writer>
      <writer>he brought his vocal talents to the small screen in Carmen: A Hip Hopera. After releasing his 2001 sophomore album</writer>

      <writer>showing that the pint-sized rapper's skills in front of the camera rivaled those behind the microphone. Following the release of his third album</writer>
      <writer>Unleashed (2003)</writer>
      <writer>he returned to the screen in 2004 for the comedy Johnson Family Vacation; snagging the lead role in Director Malcolm D. Lee's nostalgic coming-of-age tale Roll Bounce the following year. Strapping on a pair of roller skates for the '70s-set family drama</writer>
      <writer>Bow Wow's first leading role snagged impressive box-office totals in its first-weekend</writer>
      <writer>indicating good things to come for the young rapper-actor hyphenate. 2006 would find the actor/hip-hopper adding the title of wheelman to his credits when he buckled-in for the rubber-burning sequel The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift.</writer>

    <desc lang="en">Howard Inlet, an advertising executive, becomes depressed post the tragic death of his young daughter Olivia. His business partners hire actors to prove his mental illness and take over his company. (Will Smith, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet)</desc>
    <credits>
      <director>Scottish helmer Gillies MacKinnon (and scripted by his brother</director>
      <director>Billy)</director>
      <director>the film casts Winslet as a freewheeling young hippie who takes her children to Morocco in order to pursue spiritual enlightenment. Beyond the positive reviews gleaned by the film and the praise that critics lavished onto Winslet's performance</director>
      <director>one of the most alluring sidelights happened off camera</director>
      <director>when Winslet dated and then married James Threapleton</director>
      <director>the third assistant director on the MacKinnon film. The couple divorced in 2001.During 1999 and 2000</director>
      <director>Winslet dove into two roles that required her to cut loose and break free of all inhibitions. First</director>
      <director>she played another young woman in search of spiritual enlightenment</director>
      <director>this time in Jane Campion's Holy Smoke. Starring as an Australian girl who joins a cult on a visit to India</director>
      <director>and is then "deprogrammed" by Harvey Keitel</director>
      <director>Winslet's role pushed her beyond the limits of propriety and embarrassment (one scene has her standing naked and urinating in front of Keitel). Unfortunately</director>
      <director>one or two brave performances did not an unequivocal masterpiece make; the picture sharply divided critics</director>
      <director>falling far short of the praise heaped onto Campion's The Piano six years earlier. Even gutsier (though more successful on a dramatic level) was Winslet's turn as a laundress who delivers the Marquis de Sade's manuscripts to the outside world in Phil Kaufman's Quills. Winslet reentered the Oscar limelight with yet another Academy-nommed performance as a youthful Iris Murdoch in director Richard Eyre's Iris</director>
      <director>but the gold statuette eluded her a third time when Jennifer Connelly netted it for A Beautiful Mind. In early 2003</director>
      <director>she hit a low point as Bitsey Bloom</director>
      <director>opposite Kevin Spacey in The Life of David Gale. Based on the experience of a University of Texas professor -- an avid anti-death-penalty activist faced with execution after a false conviction -- Winslet portrayed the reporter who broke the story in a desperate attempt to discover the truth behind the mysterious and brutal crime for which Gale was convicted. As scripted by Charles Randolph and directed by Alan Parker</director>
      <director>the picture opened and closed almost simultaneously</director>
      <director>to devastating</director>
      <director>brutal reviews. Winslet fared better in 2004</director>
      <director>as the love interest opposite Jim Carrey in Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. This humorous and poignant mindbender</director>
      <director>with a tender romance at its core</director>
      <director>scored on all fronts</director>
      <director>as did Winslet's performance</director>
      <director>earning her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations. She followed it up with a return to period film in Finding Neverland (2005)</director>
      <director>a movie about Victorian author J.M. Barrie</director>
      <director>played by Johnny Depp. Playing the inspiration for the character of Wendy in the beloved novel Peter Pan seemed only natural for the charming actress</director>
      <director>who had long since proven herself a similarly charismatic onscreen force. The next year</director>
      <director>2006</director>
      <director>found Winslet in a quintet of back-to-back projects. In the CG-animated Flushed Away -- from Aardman and Dreamworks -- she voiced Rita</director>
      <director>a scavenging sewer rat who helps Hugh Jackman's Roddy escape from the city of Ratropolis and return to his luxurious Kensington origins. That year</director>
      <director>she also headlined the political drama All the King's Men</director>
      <director>opposite Sean Penn. Written and directed by Schindler's List's Steven Zaillian</director>
      <director>the picture cast Winslet as Jude Law's childhood sweetheart; while overflowing with talent</director>
      <director>the long-gestating remake was a major misfire with critics and audiences. Perhaps more fortuitously</director>
      <director>Winslet joined the cast of Todd Field's Little Children</director>
      <director>an ensemble comedy drama about fear and loathing in an upper-class suburb in New England. The film would net her her fifth Oscar nomination</director>
      <director>this time for Best Actress. More financially successful was her involvement in Nancy Meyers' romantic comedy Holiday</director>
      <director>as Iris</director>
      <director>a British woman who temporarily "swaps homes</director>
      <director>" as part of a vacation ploy</director>
      <director>with Cameron Diaz's Amanda</director>
      <director>and has an affair with Jack Black. Meanwhile</director>

      <director>filmmaker Howard Hall's lavish exploration of the aquatic depths</director>
      <director>designed for young viewers.After taking some time off in 2007</director>
      <director>Winslet returned in 2008 with a pair of award-winning performances. Playing opposite her Titanic co-star Leonardo DiCaprio in Revolutionary Road earned her Best Actress nominations from both the Screen Actors Guild and the Hollywood Foreign Press</director>
      <director>as well as a healthy number of year-end critics awards. But it was her work in Stephen Daldry's adaptation of The Reader that provided her with the sixth Academy nomination of her career</director>
      <director>as well as Best Supporting Actress nods from the Screen Actors Guild and the Golden Globes. The Hollywood Foreign Press made history that year selecting her the winner in both the Best Actress in a drama and the Best Supporting Actress categories at that year's Golden Globes.In 2011</director>
      <director>Winslet would win an Emmy</director>
      <director>Golden Globe</director>

      <director>and earned her seventh Oscar nomination.      Edward Norton (Actor)     Born:  August 18</director>
      <director>1969 in Boston</director>
      <director>Massachusetts</director>
      <director>United States    Trivia:  An actor of unusual talent</director>
      <director>Edward Norton attained almost instant stardom with his film debut in 1996's Primal Fear. For his thoroughly chilling breakthrough performance as a Kentucky altar boy accused of murder</director>
      <director>Norton was credited with saving an otherwise mediocre film and further rewarded with Golden Globe and Oscar nominations. Remarkably disconnected from all of the hype that is usually associated with fresh talent</director>
      <director>Norton has gone on to further prove his worth in such films as American History X</director>
      <director>The People vs. Larry Flynt</director>
      <director>and Fight Club.The son of a former Carter Administration federal prosecutor and an English teacher</director>
      <director>as well as the grandson of famed developer James Rouse</director>
      <director>Norton was born in Boston on August 18</director>
      <director>1969. He was raised in the planned community of Columbia</director>
      <director>MD</director>
      <director>and from an early age was known as an extremely bright and somewhat serious person. His interest in acting began at the age of five when his babysitter</director>
      <director>Betsy True (who went on to become an actress on stage and screen)</director>
      <director>took him to a musical adaptation of Cinderella. Shortly after that</director>
      <director>Norton enrolled at Orenstein's Columbia School for Theatrical Arts</director>
      <director>making his stage debut at the age of eight in a local production of Annie Get Your Gun. Although young</director>
      <director>Norton already exhibited an unusual amount of professionalism and took his subsequent roles seriously. After high school</director>
      <director>he studied astronomy</director>
      <director>history</director>
      <director>and Japanese at Yale</director>
      <director>and was also active in the university's theatrical productions. After earning a history degree</director>
      <director>Norton spent a few months in Japan and then moved to New York</director>
      <director>where he worked for the Enterprise Foundation</director>
      <director>a group devoted to stopping urban decay. Again</director>
      <director>Norton continued acting at every opportunity and eventually decided to become a full-time actor. In 1994</director>
      <director>he appeared in Edward Albee's Fragments after deeply impressing the distinguished playwright during an audition. Norton then joined the New York Signature Theater Company</director>
      <director>which frequently premieres Albee's plays. With a number of off-Broadway credits to his name</director>
      <director>Norton won his role in Primal Fear after being chosen out of 2</director>
      <director>100 hopefuls. He nabbed the part after telling casting directors in a flawless drawl that he was a native of eastern Kentucky</director>
      <director>the same area where the character came from; legend has it that the actor watched Coal Miner's Daughter to learn the accent. The intensity of Norton's screen test readings stunned almost all who saw them</director>
      <director>and the actor became something of a hot property even before the film was released. The same year</director>
      <director>Norton was cast as Drew Barrymore's affable fiancé in Woody Allen's tribute to Hollywood musicals</director>
      <director>Everyone Says I Love You. Like all of the other actors in the film (excepting Barrymore)</director>
      <director>Norton did his own singing</director>
      <director>further impressing audiences and critics alike with his versatility. Then</director>
      <director>as if two completely different films in one year weren't enough</director>
      <director>Norton again wowed audiences that same year with his portrayal of a determined defense attorney in Milos Forman's widely acclaimed The People vs. Larry Flynt. In 1998</director>
      <director>Norton turned in two more stellar performances. The first was as Matt Damon's low-life buddy</director>
      <director>the appropriately named Worm</director>
      <director>in Rounders. The fact that Norton's work was more or less overshadowed by the film's lackluster reviews was almost negligible when compared to the controversy surrounding his other major project that year</director>
      <director>American History X. Norton's stunningly powerful portrayal of a reformed white supremacist won him an Oscar nomination</director>
      <director>but the film itself was both a box-office disappointment and the subject of vituperative disassociation on the part of its director Tony Kaye</director>
      <director>who insisted that Norton and the studio had edited his film beyond recognition. Despite such embittered controversy</director>
      <director>Norton managed to emerge from the mess relatively unscathed. After serving as one of the narrators for the acclaimed documentary Out of the Past the same year</director>
      <director>he went on to star opposite Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter in Fight Club in 1999. Though that film garnered a mixed reaction at the box office</director>
      <director>a stellar DVD release helped the film to form a solid fan base and Norton next moved on to the slightly more successful crime drama The Score (2001). After dropping a full-fledged bomb with his appearance as a naive children's show host in Danny DeVito's black comedy Death to Smoochy</director>
      <director>Norton assisted love interest Salma Hayek by offering an uncredited re-write of the script. Norton would also make a brief appearance as Nelson Rockefeller in the film. Drawn to the mystique of screen villain Hannibal Lecter</director>
      <director>Norton's next major film was that of FBI agent Will Graham in the well-recieved 2002 thriller Red Dragon. Though a virtual remake of Michael Mann's 1986 effort Manhunter</director>
      <director>Red Dragon stood tall enough on its own terms to gain the respect of both fans of the previous version as well as fans of the book. His appearance as a drug dealer celebrating one last night on the town before serving a prison term in Spike Lee's 25th Hour drew decent enought reviews</director>
      <director>though its ultimate take at the box office proved fairly disappointing. An appearance in the high profile 2003 remake The Italian Job caused something of a rift in industry headlines when Norton made it publicly known that his participation in the film was strictly a result of contractual obligation</director>
      <director>and in 2005 the actor would return to quieter</director>
      <director>more challenging territory with his portrayal of a delusional cowboy wannabe in Dahmer director David Jacobson's Down in the Valley. A headlining performance as a turn-of-the-century Vienna magician who uses his powers to win the love of the woman he longs for in the romantic fantasy The Illusionist found Norton making a particularly powerful impression opposite Paul Giamatti and Jessical Biel</director>
      <director>and later that same year he would return to the screen in director John Curran's screen adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's novel The Painted Veil. Meanwhile</director>
      <director>the sneaking suspicion that Norton wasn't quite living up to early career expectations was growing difficult to ignore; though his turn as Bruce Banner in 2008's The Incredible Hulk drew generally favorable reviews (it didn't hurt that the film itself was markedly more exciting than Ang Lee's misguided 2003 take on the material)</director>
      <director>Norton's next film Pride and Glory proved somewhat forgettable</director>
      <director>and his quirky duel role in Tim Blake Nelson's Leaves of Grass only received a limited theatrical release before getting lost in the shuffle. Poor reviews for Norton's 2010 film Stone didn't help much to reinvigorate his career</director>
      <director>and when it was announced that Mark Ruffalo would be taking over the role of Banner in Joss Whedon's all-star comic book romp The Avengers</director>
      <director>some feared that the actor's previous rift with Marvel Studios had come back to haunt him.In 2012</director>
      <director>when he took high-profile roles in two eagerly anticipated films -- Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom and Tony Gilroy's The Bourne Legacy</director>
      <director>and two years later he earned rave reviews for his supporting turn as a monstrously egotistical and hugely talented actor in Alejandro Inarritu's Birdman</director>
      <director>a part that earned him an Oscar nomination and a slew of other industry accolades.      Helen Mirren (Actor)     Born:  July 26</director>

      <director>England    Trivia:  Perhaps the ultimate thinking man's sex symbol</director>

      <director>screen</director>
      <director>and television. With classical training</director>
      <director>years of work on the London stage</director>

      <director>1945</director>
      <director>in London</director>
      <director>Mirren is a descendant of the White Russian nobility. Her father was a member of an aristocratic Russian military family who came to England during the Russian Revolution</director>
      <director>but while Mirren was growing up</director>
      <director>he worked in turn as a violinist with the London Philharmonic</director>
      <director>a taxi driver</director>
      <director>and a driving instructor. His daughter</director>
      <director>on the other hand</director>
      <director>knew her true calling by the age of six</director>
      <director>when she realized she wanted to become an actress</director>
      <director>in the "old-fashioned and traditional sense." After trying to please her parents with a stint at a teacher's college</director>
      <director>Mirren joined the National Youth Theatre</director>
      <director>where she first made her mark playing Cleopatra. The acclaim for her performance led the way to other work</director>
      <director>and she was soon a member of the vaunted Royal Shakespeare Company</director>
      <director>with whom she performed a wide range of classics. Her stage career thriving</director>
      <director>Mirren made her screen debut in 1968 in the somewhat forgettable Herostratus. The same year</director>
      <director>she made a more auspicious appearance as Hermia in Peter Hall's lauded adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream</director>
      <director>and her screen career soon took off. She worked steadily throughout the late '60s and '70s</director>
      <director>starring in 1969's Age of Consent and working with such directors as Robert Altman on The Long Goodbye (1973) and Lindsay Anderson on O Lucky Man! (also 1973). In 1977</director>
      <director>Mirren earned permanent notoriety for her work in Caligula</director>
      <director>a mainstream porn offering from the powers at Penthouse that also starred such notables as Peter O'Toole</director>
      <director>John Gielgud</director>
      <director>and Malcolm McDowell.During the subsequent decade</director>
      <director>Mirren continued to work on the stage</director>
      <director>and she also broadened her cinematic resumé and fan base with such films as Excalibur (1981) and Cal (1984). Her portrayal of an older woman in love with a younger man in the latter film earned her a Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival and further established her reputation as an actress willing to explore the kind of unconventional relationships often ignored on the screen. The actress' willingness go beyond safe conventionality was demonstrated with her work in such films as The Mosquito Coast (1986)</director>
      <director>Pascali's Island (1988)</director>
      <director>The Cook</director>
      <director>the Thief</director>
      <director>His Wife and Her Lover (1989)</director>
      <director>and The Comfort of Strangers (1991). She again took on the role of an older woman in love with a younger man in Where Angels Fear to Tread in 1991</director>
      <director>proving that seven years after Cal</director>
      <director>her powers of attraction had been in no way tempered by time.At the beginning of the 1990s</director>
      <director>Mirren began appearing on the television series Prime Suspect. Her character</director>
      <director>Jane Tennison</director>
      <director>a hard-boiled detective</director>
      <director>proved immensely popular with viewers and critics alike</director>
      <director>and she stayed with the series for its seven incarnations. Mirren also continued to do acclaimed work for the stage and screen</director>
      <director>earning a Cannes Best Actress award and Oscar and BAFTA nominations for her work in The Madness of King George in 1994</director>
      <director>and making her Broadway debut in Turgenev's A Month in the Country in 1995. The following year</director>
      <director>she earned further acclaim for her work in Some Mother's Son</director>
      <director>in which she played the mother of a Belfast prison hunger striker. In 1997</director>
      <director>Mirren found the time to marry producer/director Taylor Hackford before signing on to provide the voice of the Queen in the Disney animated film The Prince of Egypt (1998). In 1999</director>
      <director>she played the titular teacher in Kevin Williamson's disappointing Teaching Mrs. Tingle</director>
      <director>earning the only good reviews given the movie</director>
      <director>and she again won over critics with her title role in the made-for-television The Passion of Ayn Rand</director>
      <director>earning an Emmy for her performance. Back on the big screen</director>
      <director>Mirren continued with a lighthearted role as a master gardener in Greenfingers (2000)</director>
      <director>turned up in director Hal Hartley's comic monster fable No Such Thing (2001) and earned her second Oscar nomination for her re-teaming with Altman in the director's acclaimed comedy Gosford Park (2001).This pattern solidified for Mirren as her career moved through the new millennium. She was well received for her performance in yet another quirky British sleeper in 2003</director>
      <director>with Calendar Girls. In it she played a middle-aged woman who raises money (as well as eyebrows) for a Women's Institute by posing nude with her peers. She also made notable appearances in movies like the thriller The Clearing (2004) and the romantic comedy Raising Helen (2004)</director>
      <director>before awing audiences with a performance in Shadowboxer (2005) as an assassin who is diagnosed with terminal cancer. 2005 would prove to be a special year for Mirren as September of that year would kick off a full 12 months of nonstop praise and excitement. Two of Mirren's projects would emerge during this period that would usher her into the upper tier of cinema's lead actresses -- a place that critics and fans had known she belonged all along. Coincidentally</director>
      <director>these two projects would find her playing two different English monarchs who shared the same name. First</director>
      <director>her performance as Queen Elizabeth I in the BBC miniseries Elizabeth I aired in September 2005</director>
      <director>blowing viewers away with her ability to convey the full power and command of perhaps the most important crowned head in British history</director>
      <director>all while confined to the small screen. Immersing herself into the opulent 16th century costumes and sets</director>
      <director>Mirren tackled the Virgin Queen as a leader</director>
      <director>a woman</director>
      <director>and a human being</director>
      <director>leaving such an impression that the miniseries was later aired in the U.S. By September 2006</director>
      <director>the commotion over Mirren's performance had died down just enough for her to make an even bigger splash with her acclaimed role as Queen Elizabeth II in Stephen Frears' film The Queen. Despite the shared name</director>
      <director>playing the modern-day figure was as different from her earlier role as it could be. Taking place in 1997 after the death of the globally beloved Princess Diana -- whose divorce from Prince Charles had been a source of epic tabloid controversy -- The Queen found Mirren playing a monarch who wielded little-to-no executive power</director>
      <director>but whose title derived all its meaning from tradition</director>
      <director>symbolism</director>
      <director>and national pride. Mirren handled this queen with gentle attention to detail</director>
      <director>following her on confused journeys both personal and in the national consciousness</director>
      <director>showing her surprise and bewilderment as the stoic exterior on which a queen's public face had always been built suddenly caused her to be reviled. Mirren's two Elizabeths were both honored with Golden Globe wins</director>
      <director>one for Best Actress in a Drama</director>
      <director>and one for Best Actress in a TV Movie or Mini-Series. She was further rewarded for her efforts by capturing the Oscar for Best Actress in The Queen.In the next year she appeared in the blockbuster sequel National Treasure: Book of Secrets</director>
      <director>but in 2009 she starred opposite Christopher Plummer in The Last Station as the wife of the dying Leo Tolstoy. For her work in that drama Mirren garnered acting nominations from the Screen Actors Guild</director>
      <director>the Independent Spirit Awards</director>
      <director>and the Academy. Substantial roles continued to rack up honors and acclaim for the actress in 2010</director>
      <director>as she played an intriguing role as a former Mossad agent in The Debt</director>
      <director>and no-longer-retired secret agent in Red</director>
      <director>and none other than the leading role in William Shakespeare's The Tempest - with the gender of the part changed to female. Mirren would then make a comic turn in the 2011 remake of Arthur alongside British comedian Russell Brand</director>
      <director>before delving back into drama once more with the reflective 2012 film The Door.      Will Smith (Actor)     Born:  September 25</director>
      <director>1968 in Philadelphia</director>
      <director>Pennsylvania</director>
      <director>United States    Trivia:  Given his formidable success in numerous arenas of the entertainment industry</director>
      <director>the multi-talented Will Smith qualifies as an original "Renaissance man." Although Smith initially gained fame as the rap star Fresh Prince prior to the age of 20</director>
      <director>(with constant MTV airplay and blockbuster record sales)</director>
      <director>he cut his chops as an A-list Hollywood actor on the small and big screens in successive years</director>
      <director>unequivocally demonstrating his own commercial viability and sturdy appeal to a broad cross section of viewers. A Philadelphia native</director>
      <director>Smith entered the world on September 25</director>
      <director>1968. The son of middle-class parents (his father owned a refrigeration company and his mother worked for the school board) and the second of four children</director>
      <director>Smith started rapping from the age of 12</director>
      <director>and earned the nickname "Prince" thanks to his ability to slickly talk his way out of trouble. Smith engendered this moniker as a household phrase when he officially formed the duo DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince</director>
      <director>with fellow performer Jeff Townes in 1986. That team netted two Grammys (one for the seminal 1988 youth anthem "Parents Just Don't Understand" and one for the 1991 single "Summertime") and scored commercially with a series of albums up through their disbandment in 1993 that did much to dramatically broaden the age range of rap listeners (unlike artists in the gangsta rap subgenre</director>
      <director>Smith and Townes never ventured into R- or X-rated subject matter or language). However</director>
      <director>by the time he was 21</director>
      <director>Smith had frittered away much of his fortune and had fallen into debt with the IRS. Help arrived in the form of Warner Bros. executive Benny Medina</director>
      <director>who wanted to create a family-friendly sitcom based on his own experiences as a poor kid living with a rich Beverly Hills family</director>
      <director>starring the genial Smith. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air debuted on NBC on September 10</director>
      <director>1990</director>
      <director>and became a runaway hit</director>
      <director>lasting six seasons. The program imparted to Smith -- who had turned down an MIT scholarship to pursue his career -- even wider audience exposure as the show's protagonist</director>
      <director>introducing him to legions of viewers who fell outside of the rap market. During Prince's lengthy run</director>
      <director>Smith began to branch out into film work. Following roles in Where the Day Takes You (1992) and Made in America (1993)</director>
      <director>he drew substantial critical praise on the arthouse circuit</director>
      <director>as a young gay con man feigning an identity as Sidney Poitier's son</director>
      <director>in Six Degrees of Separation (1993)</director>
      <director>directed by Fred Schepisi and adapted by John Guare from his own play. Smith also elicited minor controversy around this time for remarks he made in an interview that some perceived as homophobic. In 1994</director>
      <director>Smith and Martin Lawrence signed on with powerhouse producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer to co-star in the action-comedy Bad Boys</director>
      <director>in which the two play a hotshot pair of Miami cops; it eventually raked in over 141 million dollars worldwide. The following year</director>
      <director>Smith topped his Bad Boys success (and then some) with a turn in the sci-fi smash Independence Day</director>
      <director>the effects-laden tale of an alien invasion. Co-written</director>
      <director>executive-produced</director>
      <director>and directed by Roland Emmerich for 20th Century Fox</director>
      <director>this picture eventually pulled in over 816 million dollars globally</director>
      <director>making it not only the top grosser of 1996</director>
      <director>but one of the most lucrative motion pictures in history. Smith then tackled the same thematic ground (albeit in a completely different genre)</director>
      <director>as a government-appointed alien hunter partnered up with Tommy Lee Jones in Barry Sonnenfeld's zany comedy Men in Black (1997)</director>
      <director>another smash success. Not long after this</director>
      <director>Smith achieved success on a personal front as well</director>
      <director>as he married actress Jada Pinkett on New Year's Eve 1998. The following autumn</director>
      <director>Smith returned to cinemas with Enemy of the State</director>
      <director>a conspiracy thriller with Gene Hackman that had him on the run from government agents. That film scored a commercial bull's-eye</director>
      <director>but its triumph preceded a minor disappointment. The following summer</director>
      <director>Smith starred opposite Kevin Kline in Wild Wild West</director>
      <director>Sonnenfeld's lackluster follow-up to Men in Black</director>
      <director>an overwrought and ham-handed cinematic rendering of the late-'60s TV hit.The late fall of 2000 found Smith back in cinemas</director>
      <director>playing a mysterious golf caddy who tutors down-on-his-luck putter Matt Damon in the syrupy The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000). Smith then trained rigorously for his most demanding role up to that point: that of legendary boxer Muhammad Ali in director Michael Mann's biopic Ali (2001). The film struggled to find an audience</director>
      <director>and critics were mixed</director>
      <director>even if Smith's well-studied performance earned praise as well as his first Oscar nomination. While Smith executive produced the Robert De Niro/Eddie Murphy comedy Showtime (2002)</director>
      <director>he doubled it up with work in front of the camera</director>
      <director>on the sci-fi comedy sequel Men in Black II</director>
      <director>also helmed by Barry Sonnenfeld. As expected</director>
      <director>the film made an unholy amount of money; he followed it up with yet another sequel</director>
      <director>the Bruckheimer-produced Bad Boys II. It topped the box office</director>
      <director>as expected. The next year saw Smith pull the one-two punch of I</director>
      <director>Robot -- a futuristic</director>
      <director>effects-laden fantasy -- and the CG-animated Shark Tale</director>
      <director>in which he voiced Oscar</director>
      <director>a little fish with a big attitude who scrubs whales for a living. While Smith had proven himself as an action star time and again and had received high marks for his dramatic work</director>
      <director>it remained to be seen if he could carry a romantic comedy. All speculation ceased in early 2005 with the release of Hitch: Starring Smith as a fabled "date doctor</director>
      <director>" the film had the biggest opening weekend for a rom-com to date</director>
      <director>leading many to wonder if there was anything Smith couldn't do.The following year</director>
      <director>Smith starred in the period drama The Pursuit of Happyness. Set in early-'80s San Francisco</director>
      <director>and directed by Gabriele Muccino (a director specifically summoned for the task by Smith)</director>
      <director>the film recounted the true story of Charles Gardner (Smith)</director>
      <director>a single dad struggling in an unpaid position as an intern at Dean Witter</director>
      <director>all in an effort to be able provide for his son. The film tapped new reserves of compassion and desparation in Smith's persona</director>
      <director>as he managed to fully embody another real-life character while maintaining all of the qualities that endeared him to audiences in the first place: His humor</director>
      <director>his hustle and his ingenuity. Upon its release</director>
      <director>Happyness provided Smith with perhaps his first cinematic hat trick: critical praise</director>
      <director>a second Academy Award nomination for Best Actor</director>
      <director>and staggering box-office success (the film would become one of his largest hits). Meanwhile</director>
      <director>he began work as the lead in I Am Legend (2007)</director>
      <director>the third screen incarnation of sci-fi giant Richard Matheson's seminal novel of the same title (following a 1964's The Last Man on Earth</director>
      <director>and 1971's The Omega Man).The actor continued to keep busy in 2008 with films including Seven Pounds (despite an unintentionally comical suicide by sea life</director>
      <director>the film was a critical failure) and superhero comedy Hancock</director>
      <director>featuring Smith in the lead role as a hard-drinking ne'er-do-well who is reluctantly thrust into the world of crime-fighting. After producing a remake of The Karate Kid (starring his son</director>
      <director>Jaden Smith) and spy comedy This Means War</director>
      <director>Smith reprised his role as Agent J for Men in Black III in 2012. MIB III was a box office success</director>
      <director>in no small part due to the chemistry between Smith and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones).      Cons</director>

      <writer>Church's fading devotion to acting still made his nomination at the 2005 Oscars feel like something of a comeback even though he had remained fairly active in show business all along. A Texas native whose early career included a stint as a radio disc jockey and voice-over announcer</writer>
      <writer>Church first got a taste for acting with an appearance in the independent feature Gypsy Angels</writer>
      <writer>and a move to Los Angeles followed shortly thereafter. It didn't take long for the handsome</writer>
      <writer>young aspiring actor to land his defining role in Wings</writer>
      <writer>and aside from supporting roles in the features Tombstone and Tales From the Crypt: Demon Knight</writer>
      <writer>it was his role in Wings and the subsequent television series Ned and Stacey for which he was best remembered for some time. Following the cancellation of Ned and Stacey</writer>
      <writer>Church turned his attention primarily to feature films with supporting roles in One Night Stand</writer>
      <writer>3000 Miles to Graceland</writer>
      <writer>Monkeybone</writer>
      <writer>and Lone Star State of Mind serving to at least pay the bills. Dejected by a somewhat stifled acting career and determined to spend more time with his wife and children</writer>
      <writer>Church opted to step behind the scenes to write and direct the independent comedy Rolling Kansas. A lighthearted road movie concerning a trio of brothers' quest to find a seemingly-mythical marijuana field in the sprawling plains of Kansas</writer>
      <writer>Rolling Kansas made a brief appearance at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival before making its debut on Comedy Central the following year. Just when it seemed that the rest of Church's onscreen career may have been relegated to appearances in George of the Jungle sequels</writer>
      <writer>acclaimed independent filmmaker Payne had recalled his auditions for his previous two films</writer>
      <writer>Election and About Schmidt. Though Church hadn't quite made the cut on either of those films</writer>
      <writer>Payne had taken note of his talent and thought the former Wings star the perfect candidate to play a formerly popular television star and down-on-his-luck actor having trouble adjusting to the prospect of marriage in Payne's upcoming comedy drama Sideways. Cast opposite American Splendor's Paul Giamatti</writer>
      <writer>Church's alternately desperate and sad performance proved the heart of the film many considered to be the year's -- not to mention director Payne's -- best. The movie earned Church an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He followed up that success with appearances in the comedy Idiocracy and the western Broken Trail opposite Robert Duvall. In 2007 he was cast as one of the two-villains in Spider-Man 3</writer>
      <writer>and the year after that he starred in the biting drama Smart People. His deep</writer>
      <writer>recognizable voice led him to voiceover work in a variety of projects such as Aliens in the Attic</writer>
      <writer>Charlotte's Web</writer>
      <writer>and Over the Hedge. In 2010 he had a part in the sleeper hit Easy A</writer>
      <writer>and he played Matt Damon's brother in Cameron Crowe's We Bought a Zoo. In 2012 he was cast in the Disney flop John Carter.      Wanda Sykes (Actor)     Born:  March 07</writer>

      <writer>United States    Trivia:  A quick-witted comedien who has transcended the comedy scene to become one of the funniest comics to hit the stage in some time</writer>
      <writer>Wanda Sykes' unique blend of stinging humor and outspoken honesty has found her moving beyond a career in standup thanks to notable success in film and television. With an Emmy under her belt indicating a bright and enduring career in the years ahead</writer>
      <writer>Sykes has shown a versatility that has gained her increasing attention on such acclaimed HBO series' as The Chris Rock Show and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Born in Portsmouth</writer>
      <writer>VA</writer>
      <writer>and raised in Maryland</writer>
      <writer>Sykes rounded out her education by receiving her B.S. in marketing at Hampton University. It was around this time that an impromptu performance at Washington D.C.'s Super Talent Showcase sparked an interest in standup comedy</writer>
      <writer>and in the years that followed</writer>
      <writer>the rising starlet would continue to hone her skills on-stage. In 1997</writer>
      <writer>Sykes kicked off her small-screen career as a writer for both The Keenan Ivory Wayans Show and The Chris Rock Show</writer>
      <writer>with the latter offering additional exposure by giving the comedien a place in front of the camera as well as behind. A supporting role in Louis C.K.'s 1998 feature Tomorrow Night was quick to follow</writer>
      <writer>and a 1998 part in the HBO special Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm found Sykes in a scene-stealing performance as David's wife's best friend. By this time</writer>
      <writer>Sykes' feature career was beginning to gain momentum</writer>
      <writer>and after commendable supporting performances in The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps and Down to Earth</writer>
      <writer>she delivered a winning performance in the little-seen C.K. comedy Pootie Tang. Though her next foray into television on the short-lived The Downer Channel proved almost as abysmal as Pootie Tang's box-office returns</writer>
      <writer>Sykes endured to lend her voice to the hit Comedy Central series Crank Yankers and host the pay-cable channel's popular standup comic series Premium Blend. The following year seemed to find Sykes at her peak as she landed her own sitcom</writer>
      <writer>Wanda at Large</writer>
      <writer>and her first standup special</writer>
      <writer>Wanda Sykes: Tongue Untied</writer>
      <writer>and served as a field correspondent for HBO's Inside the NFL. Though Wanda at Large premiered to impressive ratings early in the year</writer>
      <writer>the show was moved from Wednesday to Friday nights for its second season and died a quick death in the difficult time slot. Hardly deterred by the end of that sitcom</writer>
      <writer>Sykes appeared in the hit comedy Monster-In-Law offering up zingers at Jane Fonda in her comeback film</writer>
      <writer>and appearing in the Ivan Reitman comedy My Super Ex-Girlfriend. Considering that withering sarcasm comes easily to Sykes</writer>
      <writer>it is little surprise that she has worked on a variety of animated films including Over the Hedge and Barnyard.She had a bit part in Clerk II</writer>
      <writer>and in 2008 she was cast in the hit sitcom The New Adventures of Old Christine. She had her own cable series</writer>
      <writer>The Wanda Sykes Show</writer>

      <writer>1941 in Omaha</writer>
      <writer>Nebraska</writer>
      <writer>United States    Trivia:  With ruggedly handsome looks and a lengthy screen career</writer>
      <writer>actor-producer Nick Nolte has established himself as a major industry figure. His enviable standing as one of Hollywood's most distinctive leading men was further cemented with a 1998 Best Actor Oscar nomination for his role in Affliction. A native of Omaha</writer>
      <writer>NE</writer>
      <writer>Nolte was born February 8</writer>
      <writer>1941. While a student at Arizona State University</writer>
      <writer>he revealed talent as a football player</writer>
      <writer>but whatever promise he may have had on the field was aborted by his expulsion from the school for bad grades. A subsequent move to California convinced Nolte to try acting instead. He studied at the Pasadena Playhouse</writer>
      <writer>then at Stella Adler's Academy in Los Angeles under Bryan O'Byrne</writer>
      <writer>while he held down a job as an iron worker. After his training</writer>
      <writer>Nolte spent 14 years traveling the country and working in regional theater</writer>
      <writer>occasionally landing parts in B-movies and television films. Debuting onscreen with a small role in Dirty Little Billy (1972)</writer>
      <writer>Nolte was 34 when he finally got his break in the acclaimed television miniseries Rich Man</writer>
      <writer>Poor Man (1976). His portrayal of Tom Jordache earned him an Emmy nomination and led to a starring role opposite Jacqueline Bisset in The Deep (1977). In addition to starring in the football exposé North Dallas Forty (1979)</writer>
      <writer>Nolte contributed to its screenplay</writer>
      <writer>written by Peter Gent.Showing a marked preference for unusual and difficult films</writer>
      <writer>it was not long before Nolte became known as a well-rounded actor who brought realism</writer>
      <writer>depth</writer>
      <writer>and spirit to even his most offbeat or even unsympathetic roles. Some of those parts include Beat author Neal Cassady in Heart Beat (1980)</writer>
      <writer>a homeless bum who helps a dysfunctional rich family in the hit comedy Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1986)</writer>
      <writer>a family man attempting to come to grips with his family's traumatic past while falling in love with his therapist in The Prince of Tides (1991)</writer>
      <writer>a midwestern basketball coach in Blue Chips</writer>
      <writer>and a world-weary detective in Mulholland Falls (1996).For a grim period in the late '80s</writer>
      <writer>Nolte's career was threatened by his unrestrained drug and alcohol use</writer>
      <writer>but a subsequent rehabilitation strengthened his career</writer>
      <writer>paving the way for roles such as Jake McKenna in Oliver Stone's neo-noir thriller U-Turn (1997) and his Oscar-nominated turn as Sheriff Wade Whitehouse in Paul Schrader's Affliction (1997)</writer>
      <writer>a picture Nolte also executive produced. Following this triumph</writer>
      <writer>Nolte further re-established his reputation as a major Hollywood player with his role in Terrence Malick's 1998 adaptation of James Jones' The Thin Red Line</writer>
      <writer>headlining a cast including George Clooney</writer>
      <writer>Sean Penn</writer>
      <writer>and John Travolta. If the subsequent adaptation of author Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s acclaimed novel Breakfast of Champions failed to capture the essence of the written word</writer>
      <writer>Nolte still managed to offer an impressive performance in the following year's The Golden Bowl.At this point in his career Nolte could certainly be counted on to turn in compelling performances regardless of the project</writer>
      <writer>which made the return of his former demons more tragic than ever. On the heels of a mesmerizing lead performance as an aging gambler in director Neil Jordan's The Good Thief (a remake of the Jean-Pierre Melville classic Bob le Flambeur)</writer>
      <writer>Nolte's arrest for driving under the influence in September of 2002 made headlines when it was discovered that he was under the influence of GHB. The disheveled mugshot that followed made him the butt of many a joke; Nolte would later credit the arrest for helping him to clean up his act and get back on track with his onscreen career. A late-night jam that found neighbors phoning police made headlines the following year</writer>
      <writer>and the Hulk came and went with disappointing results.In the subsequent period</writer>
      <writer>Nolte remained in good form</writer>
      <writer>with idiosyncratic and fascinating roles. He triumphed in the spectacular late 2004 drama Hotel Rwanda</writer>
      <writer>as the politically impotent Col. Oliver during the Rwandan genocide. Neophyte director Hans Petter Moland then tapped Nolte for a pivotal characterization in his drama The Beautiful Country</writer>
      <writer>released in July 2005. That same year</writer>
      <writer>Nolte also triumphed on the festival circuit with his delicate work in Olivier Assayas's harrowing dysfunctional family drama Clean. In 2006</writer>
      <writer>he voiced Vincent in the hit animated feature Over the Hedge</writer>
      <writer>and claimed a seldom-seen but pivotal role in the thriller A Few Days in September</writer>
      <writer>as an American spy desperate to reconnect with his children. Next up was Mysteries of Pittsburgh</writer>
      <writer>an adaptation of Michael Chabon's debut coming-of-age novel.In 2008 Nolte appeared as the grizzled Vietnam Vet whose life the movie within the movie in Tropic Thunder is based on</writer>
      <writer>and in the next few years he continued to lend his distinct</writer>
      <writer>gravelly voice to a number of projects including the Kevin James vehicle Zookeeper.In 2011 his work in Warrior</writer>
      <writer>as the father of two MMA fighters</writer>
      <writer>earned him strong reviews as well as Oscar</writer>
      <writer>BAFTA</writer>
      <writer>and Screen Actors Guild nominations for Best Supporting Actor.      Garry Shandling     William Shatner (Actor)     Born:  March 22</writer>

      <writer>Canada    Trivia:  For an actor almost universally associated with a single character -- Captain James Tiberius Kirk of the U.S.S. Enterprise -- William Shatner has found diverse ways to stay active in the public eye</writer>
      <writer>even spoofing his overblown acting style in a way far more hip than desperate. Years after he last uttered "warp speed</writer>
      <writer>" Shatner remains a well-known face beyond Star Trek conventions</writer>
      <writer>re-creating himself as the spoken-word pitchman for priceline.com</writer>
      <writer>and starring in a popular series of smoky nightclub ads that featured some of the most cutting-edge musicians of the day.The Canadian native was born on March 22</writer>
      <writer>1931</writer>
      <writer>in Montréal</writer>
      <writer>where he grew up and attended Verdun High School. Shatner studied commerce at McGill University before getting the acting bug</writer>
      <writer>which eventually prompted him to move to New York in 1956. He initially worked in such live television dramatic shows as Studio One and The United States Steel Hour in 1957 and 1958</writer>
      <writer>as well as on Broadway. His big screen debut soon followed as Alexei in the 1958 version of Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov.Throughout the 1960s</writer>
      <writer>Shatner worked mostly in television. His most memorable appearance came in a 1963 episode of The Twilight Zone entitled "Nightmare at 20</writer>
      <writer>000 Feet</writer>
      <writer>" in which he plays a terrified airline passenger unable to convince the crew that there's a mysterious gremlin tearing apart the wing. He also appeared in such films as Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) and the bizarrely experimental Esperanto-language horror film Incubus (1963). In 1966</writer>
      <writer>he got his big break</writer>
      <writer>though neither he nor anyone else knew it at the time. Shatner was cast as the macho starship captain James Kirk on Star Trek</writer>
      <writer>commanding a crew that included an acerbic doctor</writer>
      <writer>a Scottish engineer</writer>
      <writer>and a logician with pointy ears</writer>
      <writer>on a mission "to boldly go where no man has gone before." However</writer>
      <writer>the show lasted only three seasons</writer>
      <writer>considered by many to be high camp. After providing a voice on the even shorter-lived animated series in 1973</writer>
      <writer>Shatner must have thought Star Trek too would pass. A costly divorce and a lingering diva reputation from Star Trek left him with few prospects or allies</writer>
      <writer>forcing him to take whatever work came his way. But in 1979</writer>
      <writer>after a decade of B-movie labor in such films as The Kingdom of Spiders (1977) and a second failed series (Barbary Coast</writer>
      <writer>1975-1976)</writer>
      <writer>Shatner re-upped for another attempt to capitalize on the science fiction series with Star Trek: The Motion Picture. This time it caught on</writer>
      <writer>though the first film was considered a costly disappointment. With dogged determination</writer>
      <writer>the producers continued onward with Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982)</writer>
      <writer>at which point fans finally flocked to the series</writer>
      <writer>rallying behind the film's crisp space battles and the melodramatic tête-à-tête between Shatner and Ricardo Montalban.Shatner had to wrestle with his advancing age and the deaths of several characters in Star Trek II and Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (1984)</writer>
      <writer>but by Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986)</writer>
      <writer>the actor got to indulge in his more whimsical side</writer>
      <writer>which has since characterized his career. As the series shifted toward comedy</writer>
      <writer>Shatner led the way</writer>
      <writer>even serving as director of Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989)</writer>
      <writer>which many considered among the series' weaker entries. During this period</writer>
      <writer>Shatner also began parodying himself in earnest</writer>
      <writer>appearing as host of Saturday Night Live in a famous sketch in which he tells a group of Trekkies to "Get a life." He also turned in a wickedly energetic mockery of a moon base captain in Airplane II: The Sequel (1982). Shatner made one final appearance with the regular Star Trek cast in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991)</writer>
      <writer>then served as one of the crossovers to the new series of films in Star Trek: Generations (1994)</writer>
      <writer>in which endlessly theorizing fans finally learned the fate of Captain Kirk.The success of the Trek movies reenergized Shatner's TV career</writer>
      <writer>even if it didn't immediately earn him more film roles. Shatner played the title role on the successful police drama T.J. Hooker from 1982 to 1987</writer>
      <writer>directing some episodes</writer>
      <writer>then began hosting the medical reality series Rescue 911 in 1989. Shatner returned to the movies with another parody</writer>
      <writer>Loaded Weapon I</writer>
      <writer>in 1993</writer>
      <writer>and in 1994 began directing</writer>
      <writer>executive producing</writer>
      <writer>and acting in episodes of the syndicated TV show TekWar</writer>
      <writer>based on the popular series of Trek-like novels he authored. In the later '90s</writer>
      <writer>Shatner was best known for his humorously out-there priceline.com ads</writer>
      <writer>but also guested on a variety of TV shows</writer>
      <writer>most notably as the "Big Giant Head" on the lowbrow farce Third Rock From the Sun. He also appeared as game show hosts both in film (Miss Congeniality</writer>
      <writer>2000) and real life (50th Annual Miss America Pageant</writer>
      <writer>2001). In 1999</writer>
      <writer>Shatner suffered public personal tragedy when his third wife</writer>
      <writer>Nerine</writer>
      <writer>accidentally drowned in their swimming pool. The champion horse breeder and tennis enthusiast owns a ranch in Kentucky and remains active in environmental causes. Shatner took on a small role for 2004's Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story</writer>
      <writer>and voiced the villainous wildebeest Kazar in Disney's animated adventure The Wild in 2006. Shatner returned to television for a starring role on the popular dramady Boston Legal</writer>
      <writer>in which he plays Denny Crane</writer>
      <writer>a once unbeatable lawyer who co-founded the successful law firm where he continues to work despite his reputation as an eccentric old man.      Allison Janney (Actor)     Born:  November 19</writer>

      <writer>Allison Janney first began courting critical attention with roles in such acclaimed films as Big Night (1996) and American Beauty (1998). Able to play characters ranging from a name-dropping Manhattan socialite to a withdrawn</writer>

      <writer>Janney was raised as the daughter of a homemaker and the president of a real estate firm. She aspired to be a champion figure skater from a young age</writer>
      <writer>but any hopes of pursuing a skating career were halted by a freak accident that badly damaged Janney's leg when she was in her mid-teens. As a student at Kenyon College</writer>
      <writer>she became interested in acting</writer>
      <writer>and got her first break when she successfully auditioned for a play being directed by Kenyon alum Paul Newman. After impressing Newman</writer>
      <writer>a racing enthusiast</writer>
      <writer>with both her acting skills and her love of fast cars</writer>
      <writer>Janney went on to impress his wife</writer>

      <writer>who directed her in a number of off-off-Broadway plays during the early 1980s.Although she enjoyed early stage success</writer>
      <writer>Janney had difficulty starting her career</writer>
      <writer>something that was hindered by her height: one disparaging casting agent went so far as to tell her that the only roles she was suitable for were lesbians and aliens. Thankfully</writer>
      <writer>the actress pressed on in the face of such idiocy</writer>
      <writer>waitressing and scooping ice cream to support herself during dry spells. Her luck began to change for the better in the late 1990s</writer>
      <writer>when she started garnering luminous reviews for her work both on Broadway -- where she earned a Tony nomination for her role in 1998's A View from the Bridge -- and onscreen in such films as Big Night (1996) and Mike Nichols' Primary Colors (1998). In the former film</writer>
      <writer>she appeared as the quiet</writer>
      <writer>capable love interest of Tony Shalhoub's struggling Italian chef</writer>
      <writer>while the latter featured the actress in the minor but poignant role of a painfully-awkward schoolteacher who is seduced by John Travolta's libidinous Presidential candidate. Janney</writer>
      <writer>who had been appearing on television and in films since the early '90s</writer>
      <writer>went on to do reliably excellent work in a variety of films that ranged from The Object of My Affection (1998)</writer>
      <writer>in which she played the supercilious</writer>
      <writer>name-dropping wife of a high-powered literary agent (Alan Alda); to Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)</writer>
      <writer>which featured her as a beehived</writer>
      <writer>chain-smoking trailer park resident; to American Beauty (1999)</writer>
      <writer>in which she gave a quietly powerful portrayal of the abused wife of a tyrannical ex-Marine (Chris Cooper). Janney's talents have also been put on ample display on the small screen: in 1999</writer>
      <writer>she joined the cast of the acclaimed NBC White House drama The West Wing</writer>
      <writer>originating the role of tough press secretary C.J. Cregg.In addition to continuing her work on The West Wing</writer>
      <writer>Janney played a supporting role in the award winning psychological drama The Hours (2002)</writer>
      <writer>and voiced Peach the Starfish in Pixar's wildly successful Finding Nemo (2003). The actress' would play the neighbor of protagonist Jim Winters (Anthony LaPaglia) in 2004's drama Winter Solstice</writer>
      <writer>and continued to play small</writer>
      <writer>yet meaty roles throughout the coming years (among them include On Our Very Own and Hairspray)</writer>
      <writer>she earned mainstream attention and critical praise for her role as the parent of a pregnant teen (Ellen Page) in Juno. Ironically</writer>
      <writer>in light of her Juno success</writer>

      <writer>comic performer Steve Carell first gained a faithful following thanks to an enduring run as a correspondent on the popular Comedy Central news satire series The Daily Show. Though Carell had been performing on the small screen in such shows as The Dana Carvey Show and Over the Top since the early '90s</writer>
      <writer>it was his grating but hilariously obnoxious reports on The Daily Show that truly made him a talent to watch.A native of Concord</writer>
      <writer>MA</writer>
      <writer>and an alumni of Chicago's famed Second City comedy troupe</writer>
      <writer>Carell gained early experience with stints at the Windy City's Goodman and Wisdom Bridge Theaters. Following his feature debut in the 1991 comedy Curly Sue</writer>
      <writer>Carell made a name for himself in television as a writer/performer on The Dana Carvey Show. In the years that followed</writer>
      <writer>he would frequently alternate between film and television</writer>
      <writer>and he continued to do so after joining the cast of The Daily Show in 1999. Sharp-eared television viewers would recognize Carell as the voice of crime-fighter Gary (a role that he played opposite Daily Show co-star Stephen Colbert) on Saturday Night Live's popular TV Funhouse segment "The Ambiguously Gay Duo." Following roles in such little-seen features as Tomorrow Night and Suits</writer>
      <writer>Carell would return to the small screen for a key supporting role in ex-Seinfeld star Julia Louis-Dreyfus' short-lived sitcom Watching Ellie.In 2003</writer>
      <writer>Carell nearly stole the show from comic megastar Jim Carrey with his role as an obnoxious television newscaster in the heavenly comedy Bruce Almighty</writer>
      <writer>before once again stepping into a faux television studio to portray cerebrally challenged weather forecaster Brick Tamland in the 2004 Will Ferrell vehicle Anchorman. Carell then stepped out of the newsroom and into cubicle-land for the lead in NBC's American remake of the popular British sitcom The Office</writer>
      <writer>for which he won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Comedy Series in 2005. Carell also made a brief but indelible cameo opposite Anchorman co-star Ferrell in the big-screen adaptation of Bewitched.Carell's Anchorman colleagues also aided him in realizing his breakout role</writer>

    <desc lang="en">Danny Ocean rounds up the boys for a third heist, after casino owner Willy Bank double-crosses one of the original eleven, Reuben Tishkoff. (George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon)</desc>
    <credits>
      <director>Wolfgang Peterson</director>
      <director>the film employed a huge cast</director>
      <director>crew and budget.The media engulfed Pitt's next screen role with tabloid fervor</director>
      <director>as it cast him opposite bombshell Angelina Jolie. While the comedic actioner Mr. and Mrs. Smith grossed dollar one at the box office</director>
      <director>the stars' off-camera relationship that made some of 2005's biggest headlines. Before long</director>
      <director>Pitt had split from his wife Jennifer Aniston and adopted Jolie's two children. The family expanded to three in 2006 with the birth of the couple's first child</director>
      <director>to four in 2007 with the adoption of a Vietnamese boy</director>
      <director>and finally to six in 2008</director>
      <director>with the birth of fraternal twins.In addition to increasing his family in 2006</director>
      <director>Pitt also padded his filmography as a producer on a number of projects</director>
      <director>including Martin Scorsese's The Departed</director>
      <director>the Best Picture Winner for 2006. He also acted opposite Cate Blanchett in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's drama Babel. Interestingly</director>
      <director>that film hit theaters the same year as The Fountain</director>
      <director>a film that was originally set to star the duo. Pitt also stayed busy as an actor</director>
      <director>reteaming with many familiar on-screen pals for Ocean's Thirteen. At about the same time</director>
      <director>Pitt teamed up with Ridley Scott to co-produce a period western</director>
      <director>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford; Pitt also stars in the film</director>
      <director>as James. The year 2007 found Pitt involved</director>
      <director>simultaneously</director>
      <director>in a number of increasingly intelligent and distinguished projects. He signed on to reteam with David Fincher for the first occasion since Fight Club</director>
      <director>with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button - a bittersweet fantasy</director>
      <director>adapted by Forrest Gump scribe Eric Roth from an F. Scott Fitzgerald story</director>
      <director>about a man who falls in love while he is aging in reverse. When the special effects heavy film hit theaters in time for awards season in 2008</director>
      <director>Pitt garnered a Best Actor nomination from both the Academy and the Screen Actors Guild. Also in 2007</director>
      <director>Pitt produced an adaptation of Marianne Pearl's memoir A Mighty Heart that starred Angelina Jolie. In the years that followed</director>
      <director>Pitt remained supremely busy. He delivered a funny lead performance as Lt. Aldo Raine in Quentin Tarantino's blistering World War II saga Inglourious Basterds (2009)</director>
      <director>then did some of the most highly-praised work of his career as a disciplinarian father in Terence Malick's The Tree of Life (2011) - a sprawling</director>
      <director>cerebral phantasmorgia on the meaning of life and death that became one of the critical sensations of the year. He also won a great deal of praise for his turn as Billy Beane in Bennett Miller's adaptation of the non-fiction book Moneyball</director>
      <director>a role that not only earned him critical raves but Best Actor nominations from the Academy</director>
      <director>BAFTA</director>
      <director>the Broadcast Film Association</director>
      <director>the Golden Globes</director>
      <director>and won him the New York Film Critics Circle award (though the institution also recognized his work in Tree of Life as figuring into their decision).In 2013</director>
      <director>Pitt's Plan B production company produced 12 Years a Slave (he also appeared in the film</director>
      <director>in a small supporting role)</director>
      <director>which earned Pitt an Academy Award when the film won Best Picture. The next year</director>
      <director>Pitt won an Emmy as part of the producing team of the HBO tv movie The Normal Heart.      Matt Damon (Actor)     Born:  October 08</director>
      <director>1970 in Cambridge</director>
      <director>Massachusetts</director>
      <director>United States    Trivia:  One who graduated from obscure actor to Hollywood icon in just a few years</director>
      <director>Matt Damon became an instant sensation when he co-wrote and starred in Good Will Hunting with longtime buddy and collaborator Ben Affleck. A native of Cambridge</director>
      <director>where he was born on October 8</director>
      <director>1970</director>
      <director>Damon grew up in prosperous surroundings with his tax preparer father</director>
      <director>college professor mother</director>
      <director>and older brother. At the age of ten</director>
      <director>he befriended Affleck</director>
      <director>a boy two years his junior who lived down the street. Educated at Cambridge's Rindge and Latin School</director>
      <director>Damon landed his first role in a Hollywood production before the age of 18</director>
      <director>with a one-scene turn in Mystic Pizza (1988). Not long after</director>
      <director>Damon gained acceptance to Harvard University</director>
      <director>where he studied for three years before dropping out to pursue his acting career. During his time there</director>
      <director>he had to write a screenplay for an English class</director>
      <director>that served as the genesis of Good Will Hunting. Arriving in Hollywood</director>
      <director>Damon scored his first big break with a plum role in School Ties opposite Affleck. As the film was a relative flop</director>
      <director>Damon's substantial role failed to win him notice</director>
      <director>and he was back to laboring in obscurity. It was around this time</director>
      <director>fed up with his Hollywood struggles</director>
      <director>that Damon contacted Affleck</director>
      <director>and the two finished writing the former's Harvard screenplay and began trying to get it made into a film. It was eventually picked up by Miramax</director>
      <director>with Gus Van Sant slated to direct and Robin Williams secured in a major role</director>
      <director>opposite Damon as the lead. Before Good Will Hunting was released in late 1997</director>
      <director>Damon won some measure of recognition for his role as a drug-addicted soldier in Courage Under Fire; various industry observers praised his performance and his dedication to the part</director>
      <director>for which he lost forty pounds and suffered resulting health problems. Any praise Damon may have received</director>
      <director>however</director>
      <director>was overshadowed the following year by the accolades he garnered for Good Will Hunting. His Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor</director>
      <director>Best Screenplay win alongside Damon</director>
      <director>and strong performance in the film virtually guaranteed industry adulation and steady employment</director>
      <director>a development that became readily apparent the following year with lead roles in two major films. The first</director>
      <director>John Dahl's Rounders</director>
      <director>cast Damon as a card shark with a serious gambling addiction</director>
      <director>who risks his own personal safety when he becomes entangled with a reckless loser buddy (Edward Norton). Damon's second film in 1998</director>
      <director>Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan</director>
      <director>brought him even greater recognition. As Ryan's title character</director>
      <director>Damon headlined an all-star line-up and received part of the lavish praise heaped on the film and its strong ensemble cast. The following year</director>
      <director>Damon signed for leads in two more highly anticipated films</director>
      <director>Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr. Ripley and Kevin Smith's Dogma. The former cast the actor against type as the title character</director>
      <director>a psychotic bisexual murderer</director>
      <director>with a supporting cast that included Cate Blanchett</director>
      <director>Jude Law</director>
      <director>and Gwyneth Paltrow. Dogma also allowed Damon to cut against the grain of his nice-guy persona by casting him as a fallen angel. One of the year's more controversial films</director>
      <director>the religious comedy reunited him with Affleck</director>
      <director>as well as Smith</director>
      <director>who had cast Damon in a bit role in his 1997 film</director>
      <director>Chasing Amy. Damon next delivered noteworthy performances in a pair of low-grossing</director>
      <director>low-key dramas</director>
      <director>The Legend of Bagger Vance and All the Pretty Horses (both 2000)</director>
      <director>before appearing in director Steven Soderbergh's blockbuster remake of the Rat Pack classic Ocean's Eleven the following year. 2002 found the actor vacillating between earnest indie projects and major Hollywood releases. Behind the camera</director>
      <director>Damon joined forces with filmmaker Chris Smith for the Miramax-sponsored Project Greenlight</director>
      <director>a screenplay sweepstakes that gave the winner the opportunity to make a feature film and have the process recorded for all to see on an HBO reality series of the same name. Toward the end of 2001</director>
      <director>Damon scored a box office triumph with director Doug Liman's jet-setting espionage thriller The Bourne Identity. With this effort</director>
      <director>Damon proved once again that he could open a film with just as much star power as his best friend and colleague. Better yet</director>
      <director>Bourne reinforced Damon's standings with the critics</director>
      <director>who found his performance understated and believable. The press responded less favorably</director>
      <director>to Damon's reunion project with Van Sant</director>
      <director>the experimental arthouse drama Gerry (2003). Also in 2003</director>
      <director>Damon starred opposite Greg Kinnear in the Farrelly Brothers' broad comedy Stuck On You</director>
      <director>as the shy half of a set of conjoined twins.In 2004</director>
      <director>Damon reprised the role of Jason Bourne in The Bourne Supremacy. As the actor's biggest leading-man success to date</director>
      <director>it reinforced Damon's continued clout with audiences. Staying on the high-powered sequel bandwagon</director>
      <director>he reunited with Brad Pitt and George Clooney for the big-budget neo-rat pack sequel Ocean's Twelve later that year. 2005 was somewhat lower-key for the actor</director>
      <director>as he toplined Terry Gilliam's disappointing The Brothers Grimm and joined the sprawling ensemble of Syriana. After working seemingly non-stop for a few years</director>
      <director>Damon claimed only a call from Martin Scorsese would get him to give up his resolve to take some time off. Sure enough</director>
      <director>that call came. The Departed</director>
      <director>an American remake of the Hong Kong mob-mole thriller Infernal Affairs</director>
      <director>co-starred Jack Nicholson and Leonardo DiCaprio. Playing the squirmy</director>
      <director>opportunistic cop to DiCaprio's moral</director>
      <director>tormented mobster</director>
      <director>Damon underplayed his part to perfection while holding his own opposite his two co-stars. Damon then took the lead role in the Robert De Niro-directed CIA drama The Good Shepherd. In 2007</director>
      <director>the actor once again returned to box office franchises for the sequels Ocean's Thirteen and The Bourne Ultimatum</director>
      <director>the latter of which netted him -- by far -- the largest opening-weekend take of his career to that point. 2009 was another great year for the hard-working star. His turn as the unstable federal informant in Steven Soderbergh's wicked comedy The Informant! earned him rave reviews</director>
      <director>and his supporting work in Clint Eastwood's Invicus</director>
      <director>as the leader of the South African rugby team</director>
      <director>earned Damon nominations from the Golden Globes</director>
      <director>the Screen Actors Guild</director>
      <director>and the Academy. In 2010 he reteamed with Eastwood for the supernatural drama Hereafter</director>
      <director>and continued working with the best filmmakers of his time by landing a supporting role in the Coen brothers remake of True Grit. Meanwhile</director>
      <director>Damon tried his hand at small screen work with a memorable recurring role as Carol</director>
      <director>an airline pilot and sometime boyfriend of Liz Lemon</director>
      <director>on the NBC situation comedy 30 Rock and a lauded turn opposite Michael Douglas' Liberace in the TV movie Behind the Candelabra. Damon had long since established himself as an A-list movie star</director>
      <director>and would continue to star in big screen projects for years to come</director>
      <director>including notable titles like Contagion</director>
      <director>The Adjustment Bureau</director>
      <director>and We Bought a Zoo. Damon next turned in performances in three films set in outer space: Neill Blomkamp's Elysium (2013)</director>
      <director>a supporting role in Christopher Nolan's Interstellar (2014) and an Oscar-nominated spin in Ridley Scott's The Martian (2015).      Casey Affleck     Elliott Gould (Actor)     Born:  August 29</director>
      <director>1938 in Brooklyn</director>
      <director>Nueva York</director>
      <director>Estados Unidos    Trivia:  Elliot Gould was one of Hollywood's hottest actors of the early '70s and though he reached the peak of his popularity years ago</director>
      <director>he remains a steadily employed supporting and character actor. Gould's lifelong involvement in show business is partially the result of his mother. In classical stage mother fashion</director>
      <director>she made an eight-year-old Gould take numerous classes in performing</director>
      <director>singing</director>
      <director>and dance</director>
      <director>including ballet. She enrolled him in Manhattan's Professional Children's School and then had him perform in hospitals</director>
      <director>temples</director>
      <director>and sometimes on television. Gould was also a child model. During summers</director>
      <director>Gould performed at Catskill mountain resorts. When he was 18</director>
      <director>he made it into a Broadway chorus line. Working odd jobs in between minor stage gigs</director>
      <director>Gould did not get his big break until he joined the chorus line of the musical Irma La Douce. From there he won the leading role opposite Barbra Streisand in I Can Get It for You Wholesale. Though the two leads got good reviews</director>
      <director>the show did not and rapidly closed. During its short run</director>
      <director>Gould and Streisand fell in love</director>
      <director>and in 1963</director>
      <director>married. The following year</director>
      <director>Gould made an inauspicious feature-film debut playing a deaf-mute in The Confession (1964). He did much better in his second film</director>
      <director>The Night They Raided Minsky's (1968). While Gould's career seemed jammed in neutral</director>
      <director>his wife's popularity hit the stratosphere</director>
      <director>and for a time</director>
      <director>he helped arrange her television appearances. By 1967</director>
      <director>after years of being called Mr. Streisand and undergoing analysis</director>
      <director>Gould untied the knot with Streisand. Gould became a star in 1969 when his co-starring role in the sex comedy Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination. After playing Trapper John in Robert Altman's counterculture classic M*A*S*H</director>
      <director>Gould at last made it to the big league. Tall</director>
      <director>curly-haired</director>
      <director>more homely than handsome</director>
      <director>laid-back</director>
      <director>unconventional</director>
      <director>sensitive</director>
      <director>and unabashedly Jewish</director>
      <director>Gould was tremendously popular with young adults who strongly identified with the often confused and neurotic characters he played. Gould's subsequent few films</director>
      <director>notably Getting Straight (1970) and Little Murders</director>
      <director>reinforced his counterculture image. For a while</director>
      <director>he seemed to be everywhere</director>
      <director>but by 1973</director>
      <director>his career had already begun tapering off. A powerfully subtle performance as Philip Marlow in Altman's Long Goodbye (1973) proved that Gould had talent to spare</director>
      <director>but over the next few years</director>
      <director>he chose several independent</director>
      <director>under the radar films</director>
      <director>like California Split and Capricorn One. Over the coming decades</director>
      <director>Gould would eventually find an ideal level of fame and activity</director>
      <director>appearing in a massive number of films</director>
      <director>like Dangerous Love</director>
      <director>Bugsy</director>
      <director>Ocean's Eleven (and its sequels)</director>
      <director>and Contagion. Gould would also enjoy a beloved recurring role on the massively successful sitom Friends as the father of Ross and Monica Geller.</director>

    <desc lang="en">As London and Britain grew wealthier, the pressure for a second bridge became irresistible. This was Westminster Bridge. Rob charts the changes in British life which made this bridge possible - a greater openness to the world (it was designed by a foreigner), and a greater sense of national self-confidence, and power. Building Westminster Bridge meant clearing slums and holding national lotteries to finance it, events which changed the look of London and sparked moral panic. Rob explores the people behind this bridge, from forgotten slum-dwellers to protesters who frequently occupy it today.</desc>

A man wearing a Krampus mask has been shot during a gunfight with the police. It looks like heâs the sought-after Krampus Killer. Neither his superiors nor politicians or press want to believe Gedeonâs theory that this must be a copycat riding the real killerâs coattails. The general demand for a success after months of fear and mayhem is simply too great. Crestfallen by her public humiliation, even Ellie isnât convinced by Gedeonâs hunch. The following dispute leads to a fervid break-up of the team. Gedeonâs boisterous mannerisms get him fired from the investigation. The case is closed.</desc>

Rob charts the changes in British life which made this bridge possible - a greater openness to the world (it was designed by a foreigner), and a greater sense of national self-confidence, and power. Building Westminster Bridge meant clearing slums and holding national lotteries to finance it, events which changed the look of London and sparked moral panic. Rob explores the people behind this bridge, from forgotten slum-dwellers to protesters who frequently occupy it today.</desc>

      <writer>United States    Trivia:  A professional actor from the age of three</writer>
      <writer>Corey Feldman was kept busy early on with innumerable TV commercials and voice-overs. Feldman's first regular television work was a recurring role in Mork and Mindy (1978-1982)</writer>

      <writer>he also provided the voice of the Young Copper in the Disney animated feature The Fox and the Hound (1980). His breakthrough role</writer>
      <writer>at age 14</writer>
      <writer>was as the battered</writer>
      <writer>bespectacled small-town hell-raiser Teddy Duchamp in Rob Reiner's Stand by Me (1986). Feldman's acting career then went into decline</writer>
      <writer>leaving him with few professional choices outside of minor roles in features such as Maverick (1994) and leads in direct-to-video movies. His most successful post-Stand by Me venture was as the voice of Donatello in the first two Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies. In many of his latter-day efforts</writer>

      <writer>notably for the 1969 groundbreaker Easy Rider. Switching to film acting in the late 1970s</writer>
      <writer>Axton has appeared in good ole boy character roles in such films as The Black Stallion (1979) and Gremlins (1984). Hoyt Axton also sang the theme song for the TV sitcom Flo (1980-81).      Phoebe Cates (Actor)     Born:  July 16</writer>

      <director>though she has also tested the waters in action films and sci-fi horror. Davis showed an interest in show-business from childhood on</director>
      <director>and transferred from New England College to Boston University in order to participate within the university's drama program. After receiving a Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts in 1979</director>
      <director>she moved to New York City in hopes of being discovered. Once there</director>
      <director>Davis took on several odd jobs; the oddest</director>
      <director>perhaps</director>
      <director>being her stint as a department store mannequin. A then struggling actress turned in a job performance impressive enough to attract the attention of Zoli Agents</director>
      <director>a prominent modeling company. No longer mere window dressing</director>
      <director>the six-foot Davis worked as a lingerie model until making her acting debut in the television sitcom Buffalo Bill (1982); she would later write an episode for the same program. Her resume grew slowly but surely</director>
      <director>and it wasn't long before she won a recurring role on the long-running Family Ties (1982-1989) as budding entrepreneur Alex P. Keaton's (Michael J. Fox) maid. Davis made her first feature-film appearance playing a small role in Tootsie (1982). In 1985</director>
      <director>she played the title role in Sara</director>
      <director>a short-lived NBC sit-com revolving around a single and fiercely independent lawyer trying to make ends meet in San Francisco. That same year</director>
      <director>Davis co-starred with Jeff Goldblum in the vampire spoof Transylvania 6-5000. Goldblum</director>
      <director>with whom she would later marry</director>
      <director>once again was paired with Davis in director David Cronenberg's cult favorite The Fly (1986). The Fly's success officially put Davis on the map</director>
      <director>and she would gain further critical notice for her role as a recently deceased housewife in Tim Burton's Beetlejuice. The following year she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in The Accidental Tourist (1988)</director>
      <director>in which she played an eccentric dog-walker</director>
      <director>and reteamed with Jeff Goldblum in 1989's sci-fi musical Earth Girls Are Easy. Davis received a second Oscar nomination for her part in Ridley Scott's groundbreaking Thelma and Louise (1991)</director>
      <director>which cast her as an oppressed housewife opposite Hollywood veteran Susan Sarandon. With her film career steadily growing</director>
      <director>Davis starred alongside Tom Hanks in the role of a whip-smart baseball ingenue in Penny Marshall's A League of Their Own (1992). She broke away from supporting roles and ensemble films to play the lead role in Martha Coolidge's Angie (1994)</director>
      <director>which featured Davis in the role of a single mother trying to keep her head above water. She went on to marry director Renny Harlin in 1993</director>
      <director>who cast her in 1995's Cutthroat Island as well as the 1996 action-thriller The Long Kiss Good Night. Though playing herself in 2000's The Geena Davis Show proved unfruitful</director>
      <director>Davis' role in Rob Minkoff's Stuart Little franchise fared much better. Even still</director>
      <director>her most impressive comeback would arrive in the form a role as the President of the United States on the ABC Whitehouse drama Commander in Chief. Davis won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress after the series' first season in 2005 and the show proved to be a major critical success</director>
      <director>though it was tragically cancelled the next year</director>
      <director>despite vocal protestations by fans. Davis would continue to act in the following years</director>
      <director>most notably in projects like the comedy Accidents Happen.      Michael Madsen</director>

      <director>Massachusetts    Trivia:  Both a former Victoria's Secret model and card-carrying member of MENSA</director>
      <director>Geena Davis established herself in Hollywood by playing the quirky protagonist in a wide variety of dramas and romantic comedies</director>
      <director>though she has also tested the waters in action films and sci-fi horror. Davis showed an interest in show-business from childhood on</director>
      <director>and transferred from New England College to Boston University in order to participate within the university's drama program. After receiving a Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts in 1979</director>
      <director>she moved to New York City in hopes of being discovered. Once there</director>
      <director>Davis took on several odd jobs; the oddest</director>
      <director>perhaps</director>
      <director>being her stint as a department store mannequin. A then struggling actress turned in a job performance impressive enough to attract the attention of Zoli Agents</director>
      <director>a prominent modeling company. No longer mere window dressing</director>
      <director>the six-foot Davis worked as a lingerie model until making her acting debut in the television sitcom Buffalo Bill (1982); she would later write an episode for the same program. Her resume grew slowly but surely</director>
      <director>and it wasn't long before she won a recurring role on the long-running Family Ties (1982-1989) as budding entrepreneur Alex P. Keaton's (Michael J. Fox) maid. Davis made her first feature-film appearance playing a small role in Tootsie (1982). In 1985</director>
      <director>she played the title role in Sara</director>
      <director>a short-lived NBC sit-com revolving around a single and fiercely independent lawyer trying to make ends meet in San Francisco. That same year</director>
      <director>Davis co-starred with Jeff Goldblum in the vampire spoof Transylvania 6-5000. Goldblum</director>
      <director>with whom she would later marry</director>
      <director>once again was paired with Davis in director David Cronenberg's cult favorite The Fly (1986). The Fly's success officially put Davis on the map</director>
      <director>and she would gain further critical notice for her role as a recently deceased housewife in Tim Burton's Beetlejuice. The following year she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in The Accidental Tourist (1988)</director>
      <director>in which she played an eccentric dog-walker</director>
      <director>and reteamed with Jeff Goldblum in 1989's sci-fi musical Earth Girls Are Easy. Davis received a second Oscar nomination for her part in Ridley Scott's groundbreaking Thelma and Louise (1991)</director>
      <director>which cast her as an oppressed housewife opposite Hollywood veteran Susan Sarandon. With her film career steadily growing</director>
      <director>Davis starred alongside Tom Hanks in the role of a whip-smart baseball ingenue in Penny Marshall's A League of Their Own (1992). She broke away from supporting roles and ensemble films to play the lead role in Martha Coolidge's Angie (1994)</director>
      <director>which featured Davis in the role of a single mother trying to keep her head above water. She went on to marry director Renny Harlin in 1993</director>
      <director>who cast her in 1995's Cutthroat Island as well as the 1996 action-thriller The Long Kiss Good Night. Though playing herself in 2000's The Geena Davis Show proved unfruitful</director>
      <director>Davis' role in Rob Minkoff's Stuart Little franchise fared much better. Even still</director>
      <director>her most impressive comeback would arrive in the form a role as the President of the United States on the ABC Whitehouse drama Commander in Chief. Davis won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress after the series' first season in 2005 and the show proved to be a major critical success</director>
      <director>though it was tragically cancelled the next year</director>
      <director>despite vocal protestations by fans. Davis would continue to act in the following years</director>
      <director>most notably in projects like the comedy Accidents Happen.      Michael Madsen</director>

      <director>California    Trivia:  Although she initially gained fame for her real-life role as Brad Pitt's girlfriend</director>
      <director>Gwyneth Paltrow went on to build a solid reputation as one of the leading actresses of her generation. Repeatedly summoning comparisons to such classic presences as Grace Kelly</director>

      <director>most notably Shakespeare in Love</director>
      <director>for which she won a Best Actress Oscar in 1999.The daughter of actress Blythe Danner and producer/director Bruce Paltrow</director>
      <director>Paltrow was born in Los Angeles on September 28</director>
      <director>1972. When she was 11</director>
      <director>her family moved to Massachusetts so that her father could direct summer stock productions -- it was there that the actress began to receive theatrical training under her parents' tutelage. Schooled at Manhattan's exclusive Spence School</director>
      <director>Paltrow went on to study anthropology at the University of California before deciding to drop out to pursue her acting career. She got her first screen role in the 1991 movie Shout and in the same year she played the young Wendy in Steven Spielberg's Hook.Two years later</director>
      <director>Paltrow made her first significant impression with a chilling turn as a young con artist in Flesh and Bone. She went on to minor but memorable roles in Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994) and Jefferson in Paris (1995) before earning her first true taste of fame with her part as Brad Pitt's wife in Seven (1995). Unfortunately</director>
      <director>she got more attention for her status as the actor's girlfriend than for her work in the film</director>
      <director>becoming one of the world's most photographed arm ornaments.However</director>
      <director>the actress was able to come into her own the following year with the title role in Douglas McGrath's adaptation of Emma. She won acclaim for her work and her flawless British accent</director>
      <director>and the same year she could be seen in two more films: The Pallbearer</director>
      <director>with David Schwimmer</director>
      <director>and Paul Thomas Anderson's Hard Eight. However</director>
      <director>it was not until 1998 -- having broken off her engagement with Pitt the previous year -- that Paltrow became better-known for her acting than for her ability to look good in designer evening gowns. That year</director>
      <director>she had starring roles in no less than five films. Although both Hush and A Perfect Murder proved disappointments</director>
      <director>and Great Expectations received mixed reviews</director>
      <director>Paltrow's two English excursions</director>
      <director>the comedy Sliding Doors and John Madden's Shakespeare in Love</director>
      <director>netted positive receptions. The latter film drew particular acclaim</director>
      <director>eventually winning seven Academy Awards</director>
      <director>including Best Picture and Best Actress for Paltrow.The following year</director>
      <director>she had the lead in another high-profile project</director>
      <director>Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr. Ripley. Starring opposite Matt Damon</director>
      <director>Jude Law</director>
      <director>and Cate Blanchett</director>
      <director>Paltrow took part in a film that boasted one of the most photogenic collections of young stars that audiences had seen that year and it further enhanced her reputation as one of the most celebrated members of her generation to step in front of a camera. As photogenic as she may be</director>
      <director>however</director>
      <director>Paltrow's healthy sense of humor would give the delicate actress the gusto she needed to take on the role of a 300-pound object of funnyman Jack Black's affection in the Farrelly brothers' cheerfully offensive Shallow Hal in 2001. With roles in The Anniversary Party</director>
      <director>Possession</director>
      <director>and Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums that same year</director>
      <director>Paltrow's versatility and popularity showed no signs of waning - even if the subsequent flight attendant comedy View From the Top didn't even climb high enough at the box office to take a nosedive.Of course the failure of View From the Top could not be placed squarely on the shoulders of Paltrow</director>
      <director>and given the film's troubled production history it's a small wonder that the film was released at all. If that film had simply been a glazed-over comedy that gave its starlet little chance to shine</director>
      <director>Paltrow would close out the year with a commendable and notably heavier performance in Sylvia. A film based on the life of literary legend Sylvia Plath</director>
      <director>Sylvia couldn't have been more different than A View From the Top and provided Paltrow with a role she could truly sink her teeth into. Both her performance as well as the film itself fared fairly well through the duration of its limited art-house run</director>
      <director>despite the fact that Plath's real life daughter Frieda Hughes publicly denounced the endeavor. The film also provided Paltrow with the opportunity to appear onscreen opposite her real-life mother Danner</director>
      <director>who also played her ill-fated character's mother in the film.In the wake of her accolades from Sylvia</director>
      <director>Paltrow closed out 2003 by wedding Coldplay singer Chris Martin. The new family would soon expand five months later with the birth of their first child</director>
      <director>a girl they bestowed with the unique moniker Apple Martin. But family life didn't slow Paltrow's film career too much. By Autumn she could be seen opposite Jude Law in the sci-fi actioner Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</director>
      <director>and before the close of the year</director>
      <director>audiences could catch her in director John Madden's Proof. Paltrow played a supporting role in the drama Infamous in (2006)</director>
      <director>and co-starred with Joaquin Phoenix in the 2008 romantic drama Two Lovers. Paltrow appeared in Iron Man (2008) and Iron Man 2 (2011) as the loyal assistant of zillionaire and hero du jour Tony Stark. The actress played a brief but vital role in Steven Soderbergh's Contagion in 2011</director>
      <director>and reprised her role of Pepper Potts for the summer blockbusters The Avengers in 2012 and Iron Man 3 in 2013.      Kevin Spacey (Actor)     Born:  July 26</director>
      <director>1959 in South Orange</director>
      <director>New Jersey</director>
      <director>United States    Trivia:  An actor whose remarkable versatility has often been described as chameleon-like</director>
      <director>Kevin Spacey has made an art of portraying a gallery of morally ambiguous characters ranging from the mildly shady to the all-out murderous. His reputation as one of the best-respected actors of his generation was bolstered by an Oscar</director>
      <director>a Tony</director>
      <director>and an award as Best Actor of the Decade from England's Empire magazine in 1999.The son of a technical procedure writer and a secretary</director>
      <director>Spacey was born in South Orange</director>
      <director>NJ</director>
      <director>on July 26</director>
      <director>1959. His family moved a great deal thanks to his father's job</director>
      <director>eventually settling for a time in Los Angeles. It was there that Spacey -- who had previously done a stint at military school -- attended Chatsworth High School</director>
      <director>where he was very active in the theater. After an attempt at standup comedy</director>
      <director>Spacey went to Juilliard</director>
      <director>though his time was cut short after his second year</director>
      <director>when he decided to quit school and begin his career.He made his theatrical debut in 1981 with Shakespeare in the Park</director>
      <director>performing alongside the likes of Mandy Patinkin and John Goodman. The actor continued to be a fixture on the theater scene throughout the decade</director>
      <director>performing both on Broadway and in regional productions. It was through the theater that he got his first big break: While auditioning for a Tom Stoppard play</director>
      <director>Spacey was approached by director Mike Nichols</director>
      <director>who cast him in his production of David Rabe's Hurlyburly. The actor's work in the play led Nichols to cast him as a subway mugger in his 1986 Heartburn. Two years later</director>
      <director>the director and actor worked together again in Working Girl</director>
      <director>in which Spacey had a small but memorable role as a sleazy businessman.By this time</director>
      <director>Spacey was starting to work steadily in film</director>
      <director>although he maintained his stage work</director>
      <director>winning a 1990 Tony Award for his role in the Broadway production of Lost in Yonkers. He also did a substantial amount of television work</director>
      <director>appearing on the series Wiseguy as deranged criminal Mel Proffitt. Criminal or morally questionable activities were to figure largely in Spacey's subsequent portrayals: His first starring role in a film was as the husband of a murdered woman in the 1992 Consenting Adults. The same year</director>
      <director>he won acclaim for his portrayal of a foul-mouthed</director>
      <director>leech-like real estate agent in James Foley's screen adaptation of the David Mamet play</director>
      <director>Glengarry Glen Ross. Spacey landed his next memorable film role as yet another foul-mouthed jerk in the 1994 Swimming With Sharks</director>
      <director>which he also co-produced. He was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for his portrayal of an abusive studio executive</director>
      <director>and he gained further recognition the same year for his entirely different role in The Ref</director>
      <director>in which he played one half of a constantly arguing married couple. However</director>
      <director>it was with his performance in the following year's The Usual Suspects that Spacey fully stepped into the spotlight. As the enigmatic</director>
      <director>garrulous "Verbal" Kint</director>
      <director>Spacey was one of the more celebrated aspects of the critically lauded sleeper hit</director>
      <director>winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his work. The actor won additional acclaim the same year for his role as a serial killer in the stylish and unrelentingly creepy thriller Seven. Spacey went on to make his directorial debut the following year with Albino Alligator. A New Orleans-based crime drama starring Matt Dillon</director>
      <director>Faye Dunaway</director>
      <director>and Gary Sinise</director>
      <director>the film won some positive reviews</director>
      <director>though it made little impact at the box office. In addition to directing</director>
      <director>Spacey kept busy with acting</director>
      <director>appearing the same year in A Time to Kill and Al Pacino's documentary Looking for Richard. The actor went on to star in Clint Eastwood's highly anticipated 1997 adaptation of John Berendt's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and then had a sizable role in the big-budget The Negotiator in 1998. The same year</director>
      <director>he also lent his voice to the computer-animated A Bug's Life and starred in the screen adaptation of Hurlyburly. While doing steady film work</director>
      <director>Spacey also continued to appear on the stage</director>
      <director>winning raves for his performance in an adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh</director>
      <director>first on the London stage in 1998</director>
      <director>and then on Broadway the following year. Also in 1999</director>
      <director>Spacey won an Academy Award as Best Actor for American Beauty</director>
      <director>director Sam Mendes' dark comedy about a man experiencing a mid-life crisis. Following up Beauty with starring roles in The Big Kahuna and Ordinary Decent Criminal</director>
      <director>Spacey would later appear as a mental patient who claims to be from a distant planet in K-PAX. K-Pax proved to be a minor flop</director>
      <director>as did the actor's other major film in 2001</director>
      <director>Lasse Hallstrom's adaptation of The Shipping News. Although Spacey drew positive notices for his portrayal of a man trying to start a new life in Newfoundland</director>
      <director>the film</director>
      <director>which also starred Julianne Moore</director>
      <director>Cate Blanchett</director>
      <director>and Judi Dench</director>
      <director>quickly sank at the box office and received only a lukewarm reception from critics.Spacey maintained a busy schedule throughout 2003</director>
      <director>appearing in three disparate projects that reflected his extraordinary versatility. Besides cropping up as himself in the third Austin Powers outing</director>
      <director>Austin Powers: Goldmember</director>
      <director>he played the title character of The Life of David Gale</director>
      <director>the story of a University of Texas professor whose anti-capital punishment stance assumes very personal meaning when he is convicted of rape and murder and lands on death row; the picture received a critical drubbing and faded quickly from view. That year</director>
      <director>Spacey also starred in The United States of Leland</director>
      <director>playing the father of a fifteen-year-old (Ryan Gosling) who murders an autistic child.2004 marked a key year for Spacey. The actor -- who had dreamed of portraying crooner Bobby Darin since childhood</director>
      <director>and spent years striving to produce a biopic of the late singer through his production house</director>
      <director>Trigger Horse Productions</director>
      <director>ultimately realized that goal in December '04. In addition to starring Spacey as Darin</director>
      <director>the biopic</director>
      <director>entitled Beyond the Sea</director>
      <director>enlisted Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee</director>
      <director>John Goodman as Steve Blauner</director>
      <director>and Brenda Blethyn as Polly Cassotto. Beyond earned a decidedly mixed critical reception.In 2005</director>
      <director>Spacey cut back on his acting schedule and devoted more attention to his role as artistic director of the legendary Old Vic Theatre in London -- a position he had assumed in 2003</director>
      <director>under ten-year contract. In a Charlie Rose appearance c. 2005</director>
      <director>the actor openly discussed his desire to use his position to revive a series of theatrical classics and reestablish The Vic as one of the world's premier stage venues. Unfortunately</director>
      <director>Spacey's work here also earned some derision; under his aegis</director>
      <director>The Vic mounted Arthur Miller's Resurrection Blues in May 2006 - an effort helmed by Robert Altman - and it drew vicious critical pans</director>
      <director>one from a reviewer who demanded that Spacey resign. Although Spacey listened to the complaints about the Altman effort</director>
      <director>(shelving the production during the theater's busy summer tourist season)</director>
      <director>he vowed to continue his efforts at the Vic unabated.Summer 2006 also saw the actor appearing in the highly anticipated big-budget extravaganza Superman Returns</director>
      <director>playing Lex Luthor to Brandon Routh's Superman/Clark Kent and Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane. With a powerhouse supporting cast that includes Frank Langella (Good Night</director>
      <director>and Good Luck.)</director>
      <director>and Eva Marie Saint (North by Northwest)</director>
      <director>the picture predictably opened up to spectacular box office (becoming one of summer's top grossers) and enthusiastic critical notices. Those who did criticize the film singled out Spacey's interpretation of the Luthor role.About a month prior to the Superman debut</director>
      <director>Spacey signed with Warner Brothers to co-star in Joe Claus (originally titled Fred Claus)</director>
      <director>a Christmas comedy that reteamed Wedding Crashers director David Dobkin with funnyman Vince Vaughn</director>
      <director>and enlisted Paul Giamatti (American Splendor</director>
      <director>Sideways) as a co-star. Additional roles in the years that followed further reflected Spacey's penchant for the offbeat</director>
      <director>such as his portrayal of an envious military man caught up in psychic phenomena in the satire The Men Who Stare at Goats (2009)</director>
      <director>corrupt lobbyist Jack Abramoff in the acerbic comedy Casino Jack (2010) and a sadistic boss with a taste for humiliation in Horrible Bosses (2011). Meanwhile</director>
      <director>at about the same time</director>
      <director>Spacey took on the role of one of Shakespeare's most iconic villains in the Old Vic's production of Richard III - for which he earned considerable critical praise. In 2013</director>
      <director>Spacey returned to television on Netflix's House of Cards</director>
      <director>playing ruthless congressman Frank Underwood</director>
      <director>earning Spacey nominations from the Emmys</director>
      <director>SAGs and Golden Globes. In 2015</director>
      <director>he earned both a Special Olivier Award for his work as the artistic director of the Bristol Old Vic</director>
      <director>and was awarded an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II (though</director>
      <director>as he's not a British or Commonwealth citizen</director>

      <director>1937 in Memphis</director>
      <director>Tennessee</director>
      <director>United States    Trivia:  Morgan Freeman has enjoyed an impressive and varied career on stage</director>
      <director>television</director>
      <director>and screen. It is a career that began in the mid-'60s</director>
      <director>when Freeman appeared in an off-Broadway production of The Niggerlovers and with Pearl Bailey in an all-African-American Broadway production of Hello</director>
      <director>Dolly! in 1968. He went on to have a successful career both on and off-Broadway</director>
      <director>showcasing his talents in everything from musicals to contemporary drama to Shakespeare. Before studying acting</director>
      <director>the Memphis-born Freeman attended Los Angeles Community College and served a five-year stint with the Air Force from 1955 to 1959. After getting his start on the stage</director>
      <director>he worked in television</director>
      <director>playing Easy Reader on the PBS children's educational series The Electric Company from 1971 through 1976. During that period</director>
      <director>Freeman also made his movie debut in the lighthearted children's movie Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow? (1971). Save for his work on the PBS show</director>
      <director>Freeman's television and feature film appearances through the '70s were sporadic</director>
      <director>but in 1980</director>
      <director>he earned critical acclaim for his work in the prison drama Brubaker. He gained additional recognition for his work on the small screen with a regular role on the daytime drama Days of Our Lives from 1982 to 1984. Following Brubaker</director>
      <director>Freeman's subsequent '80s film work was generally undistinguished until he played the dangerously emotional pimp in Street Smart (1987) and earned his first Oscar nomination. With the success of Street Smart</director>
      <director>Freeman's film career duly took off and he appeared in a string of excellent films that began with the powerful Clean and Sober (1988) and continued with Driving Miss Daisy (1989)</director>
      <director>in which Freeman reprised his Obie-winning role of a dignified</director>
      <director>patient Southern chauffeur and earned his second Oscar nomination for his efforts. In 1989</director>
      <director>he also played a tough and cynical gravedigger who joins a newly formed regiment of black Union soldiers helmed by Matthew Broderick in Glory. The acclaim he won for that role was replicated with his portrayal of a high school principal in that same year's Lean on Me.Freeman constitutes one of the few African-American actors to play roles not specifically written for African-Americans</director>
      <director>as evidenced by his work in such films as Kevin Costner's Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991)</director>
      <director>in which he played Robin's sidekick</director>
      <director>and Clint Eastwood's revisionist Western Unforgiven (1992). In 1993</director>
      <director>Freeman demonstrated his skills on the other side of the camera</director>
      <director>making his directorial debut with Bopha!</director>
      <director>the story of a South African cop alienated from his son by apartheid. The following year</director>
      <director>the actor received a third Oscar nomination as an aged lifer in the prison drama The Shawshank Redemption. He went on to do steady work throughout the rest of the decade</director>
      <director>turning in memorable performances in films like Seven (1995)</director>
      <director>in which he played a world-weary detective; Amistad (1997)</director>
      <director>which featured him as a former slave; Kiss the Girls (1997)</director>
      <director>a thriller in which he played a police detective; and Deep Impact</director>
      <director>a 1998 blockbuster that cast Freeman as the President of the United States. Following an appearance opposite Renee Zellweger in director Neil LaBute's Nurse Betty</director>
      <director>Freeman would return to the role of detective Alex Cross in the Kiss the Girls sequel Along Came a Spider (2001). Freeman continued to keep a high profile moving into the new millennium with roles in such thrillers as The Sum of All Fears (2002) and Stephen King's Dreamcatcher</director>
      <director>and the popular actor would average at least two films per year through 2004. 2003's Jim Carrey vehicle Bruce Almighty cast Freeman as God (a tall role indeed</director>
      <director>and one he inherited from both George Burns and Gene Hackman). The story finds the Supreme Being appearing on Earth and giving Carrey temporary control over the universe - to outrageous comic effect. By the time Freeman appeared opposite Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood in Eastwood's acclaimed 2004 boxing drama Million Dollar Baby</director>
      <director>his reputation as one of Hollywood's hardest-working</director>
      <director>most-respected actors was cemented in place. When Freeman took home the Best Supporting Actor Oscar at the 77th Annual Academy Awards for his performance as the former boxer turned trainer who convinces his old friend to take a scrappy female fighter (Hilary Swank) under his wing</director>
      <director>the award was considered overdue given Freeman's impressive body of work.The Oscar reception lifted Freeman to further heights. In summer 2005</director>
      <director>Freeman was involved in three of the biggest blockbusters of the year</director>
      <director>including War of the Worlds</director>
      <director>Batman Begins and March of the Penguins. He joined the cast of the first picture as the foreboding narrator who tells of the destruction wrought by aliens upon the Earth. The Batman Begins role represented the first in a renewed franchise (the second being 2008's The Dark Knight)</director>
      <director>with the actor playing Lucius Fox</director>
      <director>a technology expert who equips Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) with his vast assemblage of gadgetry. Freeman also provided narration for the most unpredictable smash of the year</director>
      <director>the nature documentary March of the Penguins.That fall</director>
      <director>Miramax's drama An Unfinished Life cast Freeman in a difficult role as Mitch</director>
      <director>a bear attack victim reduced to near-paraplegia</director>
      <director>living on a derelict western ranch. The picture was shelved for two years; it arrived in cinemas practically stillborn</director>
      <director>and many critics turned their noses up at it. After a brutal turn as a sociopathic mob boss in Paul McGuigan's Lucky Number Slevin (2006)</director>
      <director>Freeman reprised his turn as God in the 2007 Bruce Almighty sequel Evan Almighty; the high-budgeted picture flopped</director>
      <director>but Freeman emerged unscathed. Versatile as ever</director>
      <director>he then opted for a much different genre and tone with a key role in the same year's detective thriller Gone</director>
      <director>Baby</director>
      <director>Gone. As written and directed by Ben Affleck (and adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane) the film wove the tale of two detectives searching for a missing four-year-old in Boston's underbelly. He returned to the Batman franchise in The Dark Knight</director>
      <director>a film that broke box-office records</director>
      <director>in 2008</director>
      <director>and he would stick with the franchise for its final installment</director>
      <director>The Dark Knight Rises</director>
      <director>in 2012. Freeman would remain a top tier actor in years to come</director>
      <director>appearing in such films as Red</director>
      <director>Invictus (which saw him playing Nelson Mandela)</director>
      <director>Conan the Barbarian</director>
      <director>and The Magic of Belle Isle.      Richard Roundtree (Actor)     Born:  July 09</director>

      <director>1942</director>
      <director>in New Rochelle</director>
      <director>NY</director>
      <director>Roundtree attended college on a football scholarship but later gave up athletics to pursue an acting career. After touring as a model with the Ebony Fashion Fair</director>
      <director>he joined the Negro Ensemble Company's acting workshop program in 1967. He made his film debut in 1970's What Do You Say to a Naked Lady?</director>
      <director>but was still an unknown when filmmaker Gordon Parks Sr. cast him as Shaft. The role shot Roundtree to instant fame</director>
      <director>launching the blaxploitation genre and proving so successful at the box office that it helped save MGM from the brink of bankruptcy. Thanks to the film's popularity -- as well as its two sequels</director>
      <director>1972's Shaft's Big Score! and the following year's Shaft in Africa</director>
      <director>and even a short-lived television series -- Roundtree became an icon of '70s-era cool</director>
      <director>and his image graced countless magazine covers. Outside of the Shaft franchise</director>
      <director>he also appeared in films including the 1974 disaster epic Earthquake</director>
      <director>1975's Man Friday</director>
      <director>and the blockbuster 1977 TV miniseries Roots. By the end of the decade</director>
      <director>the blaxploitation movement was a thing of the past</director>
      <director>and Roundtree's stardom waned; apart from the 1981 big-budget flop Inchon</director>
      <director>he spent the 1980s appearing almost exclusively in TV roles or low-rent</director>
      <director>direct-to-video features. Still</director>
      <director>he continued working steadily</director>
      <director>and in 1995 appeared in David Fincher's smash thriller Seven. The following year he co-starred in the acclaimed Once Upon a Time...When We Were Colored</director>

      <director>Pitt had split from his wife Jennifer Aniston and adopted Jolie's two children. The family expanded to three in 2006 with the birth of the couple's first child</director>

      <director>the Best Picture Winner for 2006. He also acted opposite Cate Blanchett in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's drama Babel. Interestingly</director>

      <director>Pitt garnered a Best Actor nomination from both the Academy and the Screen Actors Guild. Also in 2007</director>
      <director>Pitt produced an adaptation of Marianne Pearl's memoir A Mighty Heart that starred Angelina Jolie. In the years that followed</director>
      <director>Pitt remained supremely busy. He delivered a funny lead performance as Lt. Aldo Raine in Quentin Tarantino's blistering World War II saga Inglourious Basterds (2009)</director>
      <director>then did some of the most highly-praised work of his career as a disciplinarian father in Terence Malick's The Tree of Life (2011) - a sprawling</director>
      <director>cerebral phantasmorgia on the meaning of life and death that became one of the critical sensations of the year. He also won a great deal of praise for his turn as Billy Beane in Bennett Miller's adaptation of the non-fiction book Moneyball</director>

      <director>BAFTA</director>

      <director>1972 in Los Angeles</director>
      <director>California    Trivia:  Although she initially gained fame for her real-life role as Brad Pitt's girlfriend</director>
      <director>Gwyneth Paltrow went on to build a solid reputation as one of the leading actresses of her generation. Repeatedly summoning comparisons to such classic presences as Grace Kelly</director>
      <director>the blonde</director>
      <director>blue-eyed Paltrow has won acclaim for her parts in a number of films</director>
      <director>most notably Shakespeare in Love</director>
      <director>for which she won a Best Actress Oscar in 1999.The daughter of actress Blythe Danner and producer/director Bruce Paltrow</director>
      <director>Paltrow was born in Los Angeles on September 28</director>
      <director>1972. When she was 11</director>
      <director>her family moved to Massachusetts so that her father could direct summer stock productions -- it was there that the actress began to receive theatrical training under her parents' tutelage. Schooled at Manhattan's exclusive Spence School</director>
      <director>Paltrow went on to study anthropology at the University of California before deciding to drop out to pursue her acting career. She got her first screen role in the 1991 movie Shout and in the same year she played the young Wendy in Steven Spielberg's Hook.Two years later</director>
      <director>Paltrow made her first significant impression with a chilling turn as a young con artist in Flesh and Bone. She went on to minor but memorable roles in Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994) and Jefferson in Paris (1995) before earning her first true taste of fame with her part as Brad Pitt's wife in Seven (1995). Unfortunately</director>
      <director>she got more attention for her status as the actor's girlfriend than for her work in the film</director>
      <director>becoming one of the world's most photographed arm ornaments.However</director>
      <director>the actress was able to come into her own the following year with the title role in Douglas McGrath's adaptation of Emma. She won acclaim for her work and her flawless British accent</director>
      <director>and the same year she could be seen in two more films: The Pallbearer</director>
      <director>with David Schwimmer</director>
      <director>and Paul Thomas Anderson's Hard Eight. However</director>
      <director>it was not until 1998 -- having broken off her engagement with Pitt the previous year -- that Paltrow became better-known for her acting than for her ability to look good in designer evening gowns. That year</director>
      <director>she had starring roles in no less than five films. Although both Hush and A Perfect Murder proved disappointments</director>
      <director>and Great Expectations received mixed reviews</director>
      <director>Paltrow's two English excursions</director>
      <director>the comedy Sliding Doors and John Madden's Shakespeare in Love</director>
      <director>netted positive receptions. The latter film drew particular acclaim</director>
      <director>eventually winning seven Academy Awards</director>
      <director>including Best Picture and Best Actress for Paltrow.The following year</director>
      <director>she had the lead in another high-profile project</director>
      <director>Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr. Ripley. Starring opposite Matt Damon</director>
      <director>Jude Law</director>
      <director>and Cate Blanchett</director>
      <director>Paltrow took part in a film that boasted one of the most photogenic collections of young stars that audiences had seen that year and it further enhanced her reputation as one of the most celebrated members of her generation to step in front of a camera. As photogenic as she may be</director>
      <director>however</director>
      <director>Paltrow's healthy sense of humor would give the delicate actress the gusto she needed to take on the role of a 300-pound object of funnyman Jack Black's affection in the Farrelly brothers' cheerfully offensive Shallow Hal in 2001. With roles in The Anniversary Party</director>
      <director>Possession</director>
      <director>and Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums that same year</director>
      <director>Paltrow's versatility and popularity showed no signs of waning - even if the subsequent flight attendant comedy View From the Top didn't even climb high enough at the box office to take a nosedive.Of course the failure of View From the Top could not be placed squarely on the shoulders of Paltrow</director>
      <director>and given the film's troubled production history it's a small wonder that the film was released at all. If that film had simply been a glazed-over comedy that gave its starlet little chance to shine</director>
      <director>Paltrow would close out the year with a commendable and notably heavier performance in Sylvia. A film based on the life of literary legend Sylvia Plath</director>
      <director>Sylvia couldn't have been more different than A View From the Top and provided Paltrow with a role she could truly sink her teeth into. Both her performance as well as the film itself fared fairly well through the duration of its limited art-house run</director>
      <director>despite the fact that Plath's real life daughter Frieda Hughes publicly denounced the endeavor. The film also provided Paltrow with the opportunity to appear onscreen opposite her real-life mother Danner</director>
      <director>who also played her ill-fated character's mother in the film.In the wake of her accolades from Sylvia</director>
      <director>Paltrow closed out 2003 by wedding Coldplay singer Chris Martin. The new family would soon expand five months later with the birth of their first child</director>
      <director>a girl they bestowed with the unique moniker Apple Martin. But family life didn't slow Paltrow's film career too much. By Autumn she could be seen opposite Jude Law in the sci-fi actioner Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</director>
      <director>and before the close of the year</director>
      <director>audiences could catch her in director John Madden's Proof. Paltrow played a supporting role in the drama Infamous in (2006)</director>
      <director>and co-starred with Joaquin Phoenix in the 2008 romantic drama Two Lovers. Paltrow appeared in Iron Man (2008) and Iron Man 2 (2011) as the loyal assistant of zillionaire and hero du jour Tony Stark. The actress played a brief but vital role in Steven Soderbergh's Contagion in 2011</director>
      <director>and reprised her role of Pepper Potts for the summer blockbusters The Avengers in 2012 and Iron Man 3 in 2013.      Kevin Spacey (Actor)     Born:  July 26</director>

      <director>United States    Trivia:  An actor whose remarkable versatility has often been described as chameleon-like</director>
      <director>Kevin Spacey has made an art of portraying a gallery of morally ambiguous characters ranging from the mildly shady to the all-out murderous. His reputation as one of the best-respected actors of his generation was bolstered by an Oscar</director>
      <director>a Tony</director>
      <director>and an award as Best Actor of the Decade from England's Empire magazine in 1999.The son of a technical procedure writer and a secretary</director>

      <director>NJ</director>
      <director>on July 26</director>
      <director>1959. His family moved a great deal thanks to his father's job</director>
      <director>eventually settling for a time in Los Angeles. It was there that Spacey -- who had previously done a stint at military school -- attended Chatsworth High School</director>
      <director>where he was very active in the theater. After an attempt at standup comedy</director>
      <director>Spacey went to Juilliard</director>
      <director>though his time was cut short after his second year</director>
      <director>when he decided to quit school and begin his career.He made his theatrical debut in 1981 with Shakespeare in the Park</director>
      <director>performing alongside the likes of Mandy Patinkin and John Goodman. The actor continued to be a fixture on the theater scene throughout the decade</director>
      <director>performing both on Broadway and in regional productions. It was through the theater that he got his first big break: While auditioning for a Tom Stoppard play</director>
      <director>Spacey was approached by director Mike Nichols</director>
      <director>who cast him in his production of David Rabe's Hurlyburly. The actor's work in the play led Nichols to cast him as a subway mugger in his 1986 Heartburn. Two years later</director>
      <director>the director and actor worked together again in Working Girl</director>
      <director>in which Spacey had a small but memorable role as a sleazy businessman.By this time</director>
      <director>Spacey was starting to work steadily in film</director>
      <director>although he maintained his stage work</director>
      <director>winning a 1990 Tony Award for his role in the Broadway production of Lost in Yonkers. He also did a substantial amount of television work</director>
      <director>appearing on the series Wiseguy as deranged criminal Mel Proffitt. Criminal or morally questionable activities were to figure largely in Spacey's subsequent portrayals: His first starring role in a film was as the husband of a murdered woman in the 1992 Consenting Adults. The same year</director>
      <director>he won acclaim for his portrayal of a foul-mouthed</director>
      <director>leech-like real estate agent in James Foley's screen adaptation of the David Mamet play</director>
      <director>Glengarry Glen Ross. Spacey landed his next memorable film role as yet another foul-mouthed jerk in the 1994 Swimming With Sharks</director>
      <director>which he also co-produced. He was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for his portrayal of an abusive studio executive</director>
      <director>and he gained further recognition the same year for his entirely different role in The Ref</director>
      <director>in which he played one half of a constantly arguing married couple. However</director>
      <director>it was with his performance in the following year's The Usual Suspects that Spacey fully stepped into the spotlight. As the enigmatic</director>
      <director>garrulous "Verbal" Kint</director>
      <director>Spacey was one of the more celebrated aspects of the critically lauded sleeper hit</director>
      <director>winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his work. The actor won additional acclaim the same year for his role as a serial killer in the stylish and unrelentingly creepy thriller Seven. Spacey went on to make his directorial debut the following year with Albino Alligator. A New Orleans-based crime drama starring Matt Dillon</director>
      <director>Faye Dunaway</director>
      <director>and Gary Sinise</director>
      <director>the film won some positive reviews</director>
      <director>though it made little impact at the box office. In addition to directing</director>
      <director>Spacey kept busy with acting</director>
      <director>appearing the same year in A Time to Kill and Al Pacino's documentary Looking for Richard. The actor went on to star in Clint Eastwood's highly anticipated 1997 adaptation of John Berendt's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and then had a sizable role in the big-budget The Negotiator in 1998. The same year</director>
      <director>he also lent his voice to the computer-animated A Bug's Life and starred in the screen adaptation of Hurlyburly. While doing steady film work</director>
      <director>Spacey also continued to appear on the stage</director>
      <director>winning raves for his performance in an adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh</director>
      <director>first on the London stage in 1998</director>
      <director>and then on Broadway the following year. Also in 1999</director>
      <director>Spacey won an Academy Award as Best Actor for American Beauty</director>
      <director>director Sam Mendes' dark comedy about a man experiencing a mid-life crisis. Following up Beauty with starring roles in The Big Kahuna and Ordinary Decent Criminal</director>
      <director>Spacey would later appear as a mental patient who claims to be from a distant planet in K-PAX. K-Pax proved to be a minor flop</director>
      <director>as did the actor's other major film in 2001</director>
      <director>Lasse Hallstrom's adaptation of The Shipping News. Although Spacey drew positive notices for his portrayal of a man trying to start a new life in Newfoundland</director>
      <director>the film</director>
      <director>which also starred Julianne Moore</director>
      <director>Cate Blanchett</director>
      <director>and Judi Dench</director>
      <director>quickly sank at the box office and received only a lukewarm reception from critics.Spacey maintained a busy schedule throughout 2003</director>
      <director>appearing in three disparate projects that reflected his extraordinary versatility. Besides cropping up as himself in the third Austin Powers outing</director>
      <director>Austin Powers: Goldmember</director>
      <director>he played the title character of The Life of David Gale</director>
      <director>the story of a University of Texas professor whose anti-capital punishment stance assumes very personal meaning when he is convicted of rape and murder and lands on death row; the picture received a critical drubbing and faded quickly from view. That year</director>
      <director>Spacey also starred in The United States of Leland</director>
      <director>playing the father of a fifteen-year-old (Ryan Gosling) who murders an autistic child.2004 marked a key year for Spacey. The actor -- who had dreamed of portraying crooner Bobby Darin since childhood</director>
      <director>and spent years striving to produce a biopic of the late singer through his production house</director>
      <director>Trigger Horse Productions</director>
      <director>ultimately realized that goal in December '04. In addition to starring Spacey as Darin</director>
      <director>the biopic</director>
      <director>entitled Beyond the Sea</director>
      <director>enlisted Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee</director>
      <director>John Goodman as Steve Blauner</director>
      <director>and Brenda Blethyn as Polly Cassotto. Beyond earned a decidedly mixed critical reception.In 2005</director>
      <director>Spacey cut back on his acting schedule and devoted more attention to his role as artistic director of the legendary Old Vic Theatre in London -- a position he had assumed in 2003</director>
      <director>under ten-year contract. In a Charlie Rose appearance c. 2005</director>
      <director>the actor openly discussed his desire to use his position to revive a series of theatrical classics and reestablish The Vic as one of the world's premier stage venues. Unfortunately</director>
      <director>Spacey's work here also earned some derision; under his aegis</director>
      <director>The Vic mounted Arthur Miller's Resurrection Blues in May 2006 - an effort helmed by Robert Altman - and it drew vicious critical pans</director>
      <director>one from a reviewer who demanded that Spacey resign. Although Spacey listened to the complaints about the Altman effort</director>
      <director>(shelving the production during the theater's busy summer tourist season)</director>
      <director>he vowed to continue his efforts at the Vic unabated.Summer 2006 also saw the actor appearing in the highly anticipated big-budget extravaganza Superman Returns</director>
      <director>playing Lex Luthor to Brandon Routh's Superman/Clark Kent and Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane. With a powerhouse supporting cast that includes Frank Langella (Good Night</director>
      <director>and Good Luck.)</director>
      <director>and Eva Marie Saint (North by Northwest)</director>
      <director>the picture predictably opened up to spectacular box office (becoming one of summer's top grossers) and enthusiastic critical notices. Those who did criticize the film singled out Spacey's interpretation of the Luthor role.About a month prior to the Superman debut</director>
      <director>Spacey signed with Warner Brothers to co-star in Joe Claus (originally titled Fred Claus)</director>
      <director>a Christmas comedy that reteamed Wedding Crashers director David Dobkin with funnyman Vince Vaughn</director>
      <director>and enlisted Paul Giamatti (American Splendor</director>
      <director>Sideways) as a co-star. Additional roles in the years that followed further reflected Spacey's penchant for the offbeat</director>
      <director>such as his portrayal of an envious military man caught up in psychic phenomena in the satire The Men Who Stare at Goats (2009)</director>
      <director>corrupt lobbyist Jack Abramoff in the acerbic comedy Casino Jack (2010) and a sadistic boss with a taste for humiliation in Horrible Bosses (2011). Meanwhile</director>
      <director>at about the same time</director>
      <director>Spacey took on the role of one of Shakespeare's most iconic villains in the Old Vic's production of Richard III - for which he earned considerable critical praise. In 2013</director>
      <director>Spacey returned to television on Netflix's House of Cards</director>
      <director>playing ruthless congressman Frank Underwood</director>
      <director>earning Spacey nominations from the Emmys</director>
      <director>SAGs and Golden Globes. In 2015</director>
      <director>he earned both a Special Olivier Award for his work as the artistic director of the Bristol Old Vic</director>

      <director>Freeman's subsequent '80s film work was generally undistinguished until he played the dangerously emotional pimp in Street Smart (1987) and earned his first Oscar nomination. With the success of Street Smart</director>
      <director>Freeman's film career duly took off and he appeared in a string of excellent films that began with the powerful Clean and Sober (1988) and continued with Driving Miss Daisy (1989)</director>
      <director>in which Freeman reprised his Obie-winning role of a dignified</director>
      <director>patient Southern chauffeur and earned his second Oscar nomination for his efforts. In 1989</director>
      <director>he also played a tough and cynical gravedigger who joins a newly formed regiment of black Union soldiers helmed by Matthew Broderick in Glory. The acclaim he won for that role was replicated with his portrayal of a high school principal in that same year's Lean on Me.Freeman constitutes one of the few African-American actors to play roles not specifically written for African-Americans</director>
      <director>as evidenced by his work in such films as Kevin Costner's Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991)</director>
      <director>in which he played Robin's sidekick</director>
      <director>and Clint Eastwood's revisionist Western Unforgiven (1992). In 1993</director>
      <director>Freeman demonstrated his skills on the other side of the camera</director>
      <director>making his directorial debut with Bopha!</director>
      <director>the story of a South African cop alienated from his son by apartheid. The following year</director>
      <director>the actor received a third Oscar nomination as an aged lifer in the prison drama The Shawshank Redemption. He went on to do steady work throughout the rest of the decade</director>
      <director>turning in memorable performances in films like Seven (1995)</director>
      <director>in which he played a world-weary detective; Amistad (1997)</director>
      <director>which featured him as a former slave; Kiss the Girls (1997)</director>
      <director>a thriller in which he played a police detective; and Deep Impact</director>
      <director>a 1998 blockbuster that cast Freeman as the President of the United States. Following an appearance opposite Renee Zellweger in director Neil LaBute's Nurse Betty</director>
      <director>Freeman would return to the role of detective Alex Cross in the Kiss the Girls sequel Along Came a Spider (2001). Freeman continued to keep a high profile moving into the new millennium with roles in such thrillers as The Sum of All Fears (2002) and Stephen King's Dreamcatcher</director>
      <director>and the popular actor would average at least two films per year through 2004. 2003's Jim Carrey vehicle Bruce Almighty cast Freeman as God (a tall role indeed</director>
      <director>and one he inherited from both George Burns and Gene Hackman). The story finds the Supreme Being appearing on Earth and giving Carrey temporary control over the universe - to outrageous comic effect. By the time Freeman appeared opposite Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood in Eastwood's acclaimed 2004 boxing drama Million Dollar Baby</director>
      <director>his reputation as one of Hollywood's hardest-working</director>
      <director>most-respected actors was cemented in place. When Freeman took home the Best Supporting Actor Oscar at the 77th Annual Academy Awards for his performance as the former boxer turned trainer who convinces his old friend to take a scrappy female fighter (Hilary Swank) under his wing</director>
      <director>the award was considered overdue given Freeman's impressive body of work.The Oscar reception lifted Freeman to further heights. In summer 2005</director>
      <director>Freeman was involved in three of the biggest blockbusters of the year</director>
      <director>including War of the Worlds</director>
      <director>Batman Begins and March of the Penguins. He joined the cast of the first picture as the foreboding narrator who tells of the destruction wrought by aliens upon the Earth. The Batman Begins role represented the first in a renewed franchise (the second being 2008's The Dark Knight)</director>
      <director>with the actor playing Lucius Fox</director>
      <director>a technology expert who equips Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) with his vast assemblage of gadgetry. Freeman also provided narration for the most unpredictable smash of the year</director>
      <director>the nature documentary March of the Penguins.That fall</director>
      <director>Miramax's drama An Unfinished Life cast Freeman in a difficult role as Mitch</director>
      <director>a bear attack victim reduced to near-paraplegia</director>
      <director>living on a derelict western ranch. The picture was shelved for two years; it arrived in cinemas practically stillborn</director>
      <director>and many critics turned their noses up at it. After a brutal turn as a sociopathic mob boss in Paul McGuigan's Lucky Number Slevin (2006)</director>
      <director>Freeman reprised his turn as God in the 2007 Bruce Almighty sequel Evan Almighty; the high-budgeted picture flopped</director>
      <director>but Freeman emerged unscathed. Versatile as ever</director>
      <director>he then opted for a much different genre and tone with a key role in the same year's detective thriller Gone</director>
      <director>Baby</director>
      <director>Gone. As written and directed by Ben Affleck (and adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane) the film wove the tale of two detectives searching for a missing four-year-old in Boston's underbelly. He returned to the Batman franchise in The Dark Knight</director>
      <director>a film that broke box-office records</director>
      <director>in 2008</director>
      <director>and he would stick with the franchise for its final installment</director>
      <director>The Dark Knight Rises</director>
      <director>in 2012. Freeman would remain a top tier actor in years to come</director>
      <director>appearing in such films as Red</director>
      <director>Invictus (which saw him playing Nelson Mandela)</director>
      <director>Conan the Barbarian</director>
      <director>and The Magic of Belle Isle.      Richard Roundtree (Actor)     Born:  July 09</director>
      <director>1942 in New Rochelle</director>
      <director>New York</director>
      <director>United States    Trivia:  Blaxploitation superstar Richard Roundtree earned screen immortality during the 1970s as the legendary Shaft</director>
      <director>"the black private dick that's the sex machine to all the chicks." Born July 9</director>
      <director>1942</director>
      <director>in New Rochelle</director>
      <director>NY</director>
      <director>Roundtree attended college on a football scholarship but later gave up athletics to pursue an acting career. After touring as a model with the Ebony Fashion Fair</director>
      <director>he joined the Negro Ensemble Company's acting workshop program in 1967. He made his film debut in 1970's What Do You Say to a Naked Lady?</director>
      <director>but was still an unknown when filmmaker Gordon Parks Sr. cast him as Shaft. The role shot Roundtree to instant fame</director>
      <director>launching the blaxploitation genre and proving so successful at the box office that it helped save MGM from the brink of bankruptcy. Thanks to the film's popularity -- as well as its two sequels</director>
      <director>1972's Shaft's Big Score! and the following year's Shaft in Africa</director>
      <director>and even a short-lived television series -- Roundtree became an icon of '70s-era cool</director>
      <director>and his image graced countless magazine covers. Outside of the Shaft franchise</director>
      <director>he also appeared in films including the 1974 disaster epic Earthquake</director>
      <director>1975's Man Friday</director>
      <director>and the blockbuster 1977 TV miniseries Roots. By the end of the decade</director>
      <director>the blaxploitation movement was a thing of the past</director>
      <director>and Roundtree's stardom waned; apart from the 1981 big-budget flop Inchon</director>
      <director>he spent the 1980s appearing almost exclusively in TV roles or low-rent</director>
      <director>direct-to-video features. Still</director>
      <director>he continued working steadily</director>
      <director>and in 1995 appeared in David Fincher's smash thriller Seven. The following year he co-starred in the acclaimed Once Upon a Time...When We Were Colored</director>
      <director>and also teamed with fellow blaxploitation vets Pam Grier and Fred "the Hammer" Williamson in Original Gangstas. In 1997</director>
      <director>Roundtree returned to series television in 413 Hope St.</director>

      <writer>California</writer>
      <writer>United States    Trivia:  A professional actor from the age of three</writer>
      <writer>Corey Feldman was kept busy early on with innumerable TV commercials and voice-overs. Feldman's first regular television work was a recurring role in Mork and Mindy (1978-1982)</writer>
      <writer>followed by the part of Regi Tower in the weekly sitcom version of The Bad News Bears (1979). He made his earliest film appearance as the inquisitive kid in the museum in Time After Time (1979). In the early '80s</writer>
      <writer>Feldman showed up in several episodes of the syndicated Madame's Place (1982) and played precocious-brat roles in such fantasy flicks as Gremlins (1984) and The Goonies (1985). During this period</writer>
      <writer>he also provided the voice of the Young Copper in the Disney animated feature The Fox and the Hound (1980). His breakthrough role</writer>
      <writer>at age 14</writer>
      <writer>was as the battered</writer>
      <writer>bespectacled small-town hell-raiser Teddy Duchamp in Rob Reiner's Stand by Me (1986). Feldman's acting career then went into decline</writer>
      <writer>leaving him with few professional choices outside of minor roles in features such as Maverick (1994) and leads in direct-to-video movies. His most successful post-Stand by Me venture was as the voice of Donatello in the first two Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies. In many of his latter-day efforts</writer>

      <writer>from the Kingston Trio's "Greenback Dollar" to Ringo Starr's "The No No Song." Axton's film career until the mid 1980s was confined to soundtrack contributions</writer>
      <writer>notably for the 1969 groundbreaker Easy Rider. Switching to film acting in the late 1970s</writer>
      <writer>Axton has appeared in good ole boy character roles in such films as The Black Stallion (1979) and Gremlins (1984). Hoyt Axton also sang the theme song for the TV sitcom Flo (1980-81).      Phoebe Cates (Actor)     Born:  July 16</writer>
